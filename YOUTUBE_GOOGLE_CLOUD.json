        "description": "*Featured in this video:* Harish Rao, Global VP of Data and Analytics for Costco Wholesale\n\n*Executive summary:* Beloved bulk retailer Costco operates more than 900 warehouses globally, with members getting discounts on everything from food to flights. To serve its members with great experiences, value, and products across any channel \u2014 in-person, via email, mobile app, or marketplace \u2014 the data team needed to build a member 360 view. Costco chose Google Cloud\u2019s data and AI tools and partnered with Accenture to build its Unified Data Platform. The new platform brings trusted data to its 175,000 users, helping them to make better, faster decisions. And suppliers can better understand member behavior through aggregated data, all with the same goal: bringing value to members and delighting them with the merchandise in any Costco warehouse. Using Vertex and Gemini AI capabilities was foundational to the new platform\u2019s ability to empower and expand teams\u2019 work.\n\n*Challenge:* Costco maintains massive amounts of data and needed a modern data and AI platform to add even more innovation, efficiency, and flexibility to help its teams meet their shared goal of bringing value to members. With so many partners, hyperscalers, and technologies available, and with so much data, Costco enlisted Accenture\u2019s help in researching and creating the right omnichannel solution.\n\n*Solution:* Costco knew they would need a large data and AI footprint, so Google Cloud\u2019s product depth, hyperscale, cost-effectiveness, and native capabilities were the right fit. Costco\u2019s team built a robust platform, allowing them to democratize data to teams across the company and open up new opportunities, such as helping merchandisers understand sales and inventory positions, track promotion performance, and improve return and other processes.\n\n*Results:* The data team has already seen short-term wins with its unified platform, such as cutting the time required to create new audiences from several weeks to 30 minutes. Suppliers can access aggregated data about member shopping behavior to tailor their offerings. In the longer term, Costco is using data and AI technology to bring more value to members and to the bottom line. As Costco\u2019s leadership prepares to profitably double the company size in the next decade, AI capabilities will be crucial for omnichannel measurement, flexibility, and speed.\n\n*Key takeaways and highlights from our interview with Harish Rao, Global VP of Data and Analytics for Costco Wholesale:*\n\n\u2192 \u201cCostco's philosophy is to think about continuous improvement. This partnership is not just, \u2018scale and you\u2019re done.\u2019 It\u2019s about continuous innovation to deliver superior member experience. That is who we are at Costco, and that applies to everything.\u201d \n\n\u2192 \u201cThe digital transformation journey is nothing generic that you can pick from. It all depends on your core values and core principles. We go back to our core value proposition of delivering superior member experience, delivering great product and great value. This is a great opportunity for Costco to look at a complete 360-degree view of our members.\u201d\n\n\u2192 \u201cThe expectation is to double the company over the next decade. Imagine when you\u2019re a $500 billion enterprise, what does that really look like? The business model is not just to drive a broader revenue model. It goes back to how we drive more value to our members and suppliers.\u201d\n\n*Google Cloud products used:* Vertex AI, Gemini, BigQuery, Bigtable\n\n*Learn more:*\n\n\u2192 Accenture\u2019s Enterprise CTO: \u201cGen AI really changes how we interact with all kinds of work\u201d https://cloud.google.com/transform/accentures-enterprise-cto-gen-ai-changes-how-we-interact-with-all-kinds-of-work\n\n\u2192 Empowering retailers with AI for commerce, marketing, supply chains, and more https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/retail/retail-cpg-ai-partner-ecosystem-nrf-2025 \n\n\u2192 Realize the True Potential of Omnichannel https://cloud.google.com/files/apigee/apigee-realize-true-potential-of-omnichannel-ebook.pdf",

        "description": "*Featured in this video:* SeokYoung Lee, Director, Head of Mobile Agent Services at LG U+\n\n*Executive summary:* Mobile network operator LG U+ chose Google Cloud AI to enhance on-device features for its more than 18 million subscribers across South Korea. As LG U+ continually works to bring customers convenient, easy-to-use mobile devices, they\u2019ve used Gemini and Vertex AI to add call summarization, visual call interfaces, spam detection, and AI call answering for users. In the competitive telecom market, and as LG U+ prepares for international expansion, the company chose Google AI products to differentiate its services and grow revenue. \n\n*Challenge:* LG U+ aimed to expand its services beyond South Korea, but needed to add to its existing capabilities quickly to serve users in real time with helpful, convenient AI features.\n \n*Solution:* The mobile agent services team integrated Gemini into its ixi-O phone agent for more actionable AI that can understand user intent and respond accordingly. The LG U+ ixi-O One agent pairs its own device AI \u2014 which transcribes and records calls in real time \u2014 with Gemini, which performs sophisticated analysis to summarize conversations and suggest follow-up actions. Next, the mobile agent team will use Vertex AI to add features that recommend responses during calls based on content searches, as well as retrieve relevant locations, objects and contextual information. \n\n*Results:* With newly expanded AI capabilities, LG U+ will expand internationally, partnering with both Google and other telecom companies. The team\u2019s plans for the coming year include building even deeper data-driven customer understanding into its products and creating an advanced autonomous agent. \n\n*Key takeaways and highlights from our interview with SeokYoung Lee, Director, Head of Mobile Agent Services at LG U+:*\n\n\u2192 \u201cOur team\u2019s motto is \u2018turning imagination into reality.\u2019 Google plays two key roles in this: first is enhancing our imagination, and second is providing practical technologies and solutions that make our ideas real.\u201d \n\n\u2192 \u201cAt LG U+, gen AI and Vertex AI are helping us with a smarter call agent, ixi-O. The problems we aim to solve with ixi-O One were not new, but solving them with AI was incredibly exciting.\u201d\n\n\u2192 \u201cAI allows everyone to start again from the same starting line. Even large businesses can be completely transformed by AI. Telecom companies have been offering similar services, but AI can create entirely new differentiation.\u201d\n\n\u2192 \u201cThe most valuable benefit we get from collaborating with Google is that Google has a complete stack of AI. For example, Google Cloud has AI Hypercomputer and research and models and also has Vertex AI to build an agile agent.\u201d\n\n*Google Cloud products used:* Gemini, Vertex AI\n\n*Learn more:*\n\n\u2192 The AI-driven telecom: A new era of network transformation https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/telecommunications/the-ai-driven-telecom-a-new-era-of-network-transformation\n\n\u2192 Next \u201925 recap: Telecommunications https://cloud.google.com/transform/telco-next25-wrapup-telco-cloud-news \n\n\u2192 Here to serve Korea\u2019s businesses with a new GCP region in Seoul\nhttps://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/new-gcp-region-in-seoul",
