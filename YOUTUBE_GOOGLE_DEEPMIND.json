See how it takes a complex, single prompt and uses its reasoning capabilities to write executable code for a polished, interactive 3D game — complete with neon aesthetics and particle effects — all within a single HTML file.\n\nWhat will Gemini build if you change 'retro spaceship' to something else?\n\nTry the demo in Google AI Studio: https://aistudio-preprod.corp.google.com/apps/bundled/synthwave_space\nFind out more about Gemini 3: https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/\n\n___\n\nPrompt: \"\"Create a polished, retro-futuristic 3D spaceship web game contained entirely within a single HTML file using Three.js. The game should feature a \"\"\"\"Synthwave/Retrowave\"\"\"\" aesthetic with the following specifications:\n\n### 1. Visual Style & Atmosphere\n*   **Aesthetic:** Dark, immersive 3D environment with a glowing, volumetric neon look. Use a color palette of deep purples, hot pinks, and electric cyans.\n*   **Post-Processing:** You must implement Three.js `EffectComposer` with `UnrealBloomPass` to make the neon elements glow intensely.\n*   **Environment:** \n    *   A dense, moving starfield background with rich features. Go beyond simple plane shapes here and apply shaders to make the game visually appealing. For example, simulating retro astra, stars, and planets in the background.\n    *   Distance fog to fade distant objects smoothly into the darkness.\n*   **Assets:** Use complex geometric primitives constructed programmatically (no external model imports).\n\n### 2. Gameplay Mechanics\n*   **Perspective:** Third-person view from behind the spaceship.\n*   **Core Loop:** The player pilots the ship on the X and Y axis (2D plane) while enemies (neon blocks) spawn in the distance and fly toward the camera along the Z-axis.\n*   **Combat:** \n    *   The player shoots laser bolts (glowing lines) to destroy enemies.\n    *   **Collision:** When a laser hits a block, the block should shatter into a very complex particle explosion effect.\n    *   **Game Over:** If a block hits the ship, the game ends.\n*   **UI:** A minimal HUD displaying the current Score. A \"\"\"\"Game Over\"\"\"\" overlay with a \"\"\"\"Restart\"\"\"\" button.\n\n### 3. Controls (Cross-Platform)\nThe game must detect the device type or input method:\n*   **Desktop/Web:** \n    *   Use **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** for smooth movement (apply `lerp` or friction for a floaty, drift-like spaceship feel).\n    *   Use **Spacebar** to fire.\n*   **Mobile/Touch:** \n    *   Render a semi-transparent **Virtual Joystick** on the bottom-left of the screen (using HTML/CSS or Canvas API) to map touch movement to ship coordinates.\n    *   Detect a **Tap** anywhere on the right side of the screen to fire lasers.\n\n### 4. Technical Constraints\n*   **Single File:** All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including the Three.js library and post-processing shaders imported via CDN) must be in one `index.html` file. Do not output any other text other than the html response.\n*   **Performance:** Use object pooling for lasers and particles to ensure 60FPS performance.\n*   **Responsiveness:** The canvas must resize dynamically to fit any screen size without stretching the aspect ratio.\"\"\n\n___\n\nSubscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind\nFind us on X https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind\nFollow us on Instagram https://instagram.com/googledeepmind\nAdd us on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmind/",

Use a tropical pastel palette (Coral Pinks, Seafoam Greens, Lemon Yellows).\nInclude an animation using a suitable library featuring a gently animated pink Flamingo (Large circular container with the Animated Flamingo Vector. Make sure the animation is smooth and whimsical, but the flamingo looks realistic. Do not add clothes or sunglasses.)\nTypography: Use curvy, heavy retro script fonts (like diner signage) for headers with hard drop shadows. Use geometric sans-serifs for body text.\nShapes: Everything must be rounded. Pill-shaped buttons, circular image masks, and soft corners on text boxes.\nContent Sections: The Class, Prices, Contact.\nMake the site fully responsive.\nUse a \"\"Warm vs. Cool\"\" contrast strategy (Pastel Pink / light gradient background vs. Teal accents).\nMake sure the page is family friendly. Do not include real artist names.\nBe as creative as possible and show off your best front end coding skills!\nBefore finalizing the page ensure the Flamingo animation looks good (coherent, consistent, easily 'readable', stylized and smooth).

See how it takes a complex, single prompt and uses its reasoning capabilities to write executable code for a polished, interactive 3D game — complete with neon aesthetics and particle effects — all within a single HTML file.\n\nWhat will Gemini build if you change 'retro spaceship' to something else?\n\nFind out more about Gemini 3: https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/\n___\n\nPrompt: \"\"Create a polished, retro-futuristic 3D spaceship web game contained entirely within a single HTML file using Three.js. The game should feature a \"\"\"\"Synthwave/Retrowave\"\"\"\" aesthetic with the following specifications:\n\n### 1. Visual Style & Atmosphere\n*   **Aesthetic:** Dark, immersive 3D environment with a glowing, volumetric neon look. Use a color palette of deep purples, hot pinks, and electric cyans.\n*   **Post-Processing:** You must implement Three.js `EffectComposer` with `UnrealBloomPass` to make the neon elements glow intensely.\n*   **Environment:** \n    *   A dense, moving starfield background with rich features. Go beyond simple plane shapes here and apply shaders to make the game visually appealing. For example, simulating retro astra, stars, and planets in the background.\n    *   Distance fog to fade distant objects smoothly into the darkness.\n*   **Assets:** Use complex geometric primitives constructed programmatically (no external model imports).\n\n### 2. Gameplay Mechanics\n*   **Perspective:** Third-person view from behind the spaceship.\n*   **Core Loop:** The player pilots the ship on the X and Y axis (2D plane) while enemies (neon blocks) spawn in the distance and fly toward the camera along the Z-axis.\n*   **Combat:** \n    *   The player shoots laser bolts (glowing lines) to destroy enemies.\n    *   **Collision:** When a laser hits a block, the block should shatter into a very complex particle explosion effect.\n    *   **Game Over:** If a block hits the ship, the game ends.\n*   **UI:** A minimal HUD displaying the current Score. A \"\"\"\"Game Over\"\"\"\" overlay with a \"\"\"\"Restart\"\"\"\" button.\n\n### 3. Controls (Cross-Platform)\nThe game must detect the device type or input method:\n*   **Desktop/Web:** \n    *   Use **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** for smooth movement (apply `lerp` or friction for a floaty, drift-like spaceship feel).\n    *   Use **Spacebar** to fire.\n*   **Mobile/Touch:** \n    *   Render a semi-transparent **Virtual Joystick** on the bottom-left of the screen (using HTML/CSS or Canvas API) to map touch movement to ship coordinates.\n    *   Detect a **Tap** anywhere on the right side of the screen to fire lasers.\n\n### 4. Technical Constraints\n*   **Single File:** All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including the Three.js library and post-processing shaders imported via CDN) must be in one `index.html` file. Do not output any other text other than the html response.\n*   **Performance:** Use object pooling for lasers and particles to ensure 60FPS performance.\n*   **Responsiveness:** The canvas must resize dynamically to fit any screen size without stretching the aspect ratio.\"\"\n\n___\n\nSubscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind\nFind us on X https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind\nFollow us on Instagram https://instagram.com/googledeepmind\nAdd us on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmind/",

        "description": "We’re powering an era of physical agents with Gemini Robotics 1.5 — enabling robots to perceive, plan, think, use tools and act to better solve complex, multi-step tasks.\n\n🤖 Gemini Robotics 1.5 is our most capable vision-language-action (VLA) model that turns visual information and instructions into motor commands for a robot to perform a task. This model thinks before taking action and shows its process, helping robots assess and complete complex tasks more transparently. It also learns across embodiments, accelerating skill learning.\n\n🤖 Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is our most capable vision-language model (VLM) that reasons about the physical world, natively calls digital tools and creates detailed, multi-step plans to complete a mission. This model now achieves state-of-the-art performance across spatial understanding benchmarks.\n\nWe’re making Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 available to developers via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and Gemini Robotics 1.5 to select partners.\n\nLearn more: https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-robotics/\n\n------\n\nSubscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind\nFind us on X https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind\nFollow us on Instagram https://instagram.com/googledeepmind\nAdd us on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmind/",
