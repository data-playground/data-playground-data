It surpasses our previous state-of-the-art model on 99.9% of weather variables.\n\n\\u26a1\\ufe0f This model is enabled by a new AI modelling approach called a Functional Generative Network (FGN), allowing it to predict thousands of possible weather outcomes from a single starting point in less than a minute on a single TPU.\n\nWeatherNext technology is already upgrading forecasts in Search, Gemini, Pixel Weather, and Google Maps Platform\\u2019s Weather API. Businesses can now customize WeatherNext 2 models and create forecasts through Google Cloud Vertex AI. WeatherNext 2 is also available for downstream model training via BigQuery and Google Earth Engine.\n\nLearn more at https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/weathernext-2 \n\n___\n\nSubscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind\nFind us on X https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind\nFollow us on Instagram https://instagram.com/googledeepmind\nAdd us on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmind/",

Hannah Fry and Four Flynn take us behind the scenes of Operation Aurora, the monumental 2009 attack on Google that forever changed the landscape of cybersecurity. They discuss the defender's dilemma, the constant battle between attackers and defenders in the digital world, and how AI can potentially help mitigate some of the most complex vulnerabilities.\n\nAs Hannah said, there was just too much to fit into one episode, so keep an eye on your feed for part 2.

        "description": "Using Gemini and Google DeepMind\\u2019s generative image technology, we worked with Lovegrove Studio to build a fine-tuned model to act as a prototyping tool to support their creative process. The model translates Ross Lovegrove's distinct design language of organic, fluidlike structures and biomorphic forms into outputs that reflect his style, while also offering new directions. The result is a unique, fine-tuned model that can produce new ideas true to the studio\\u2019s vision, demonstrating how AI can help artists move from a digital concept to a physical product.\n\nThis was a partnership with designer Ross Lovegrove and Creative Director Ila Colombo from Lovegrove Studio, as well as design office Modem and Serial Box studio.\n\nLearn more at https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/ross-lovegrove-design and try generating or editing your own images with Gemini at http://gemini.google\n\n___\n\nSubscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind\nFind us on X https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind\nFollow us on Instagram https://instagram.com/googledeepmind\nAdd us on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmind/",

For example, if a robot was asked, \\u201cBased on my location, can you sort these objects into the correct compost, recycling and trash bins?\" it would need to search for relevant local recycling guidelines on the internet, look at the objects in front of it and figure out how to sort them based on those rules \\u2014 and then do all the steps needed to completely put them away. So, to help robots complete these types of complex, multi-step tasks, we designed two models that work together in an agentic framework. \n\nLearn more at https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-robotics/\n___\n\nSubscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind\nFind us on X https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind\nFollow us on Instagram https://instagram.com/googledeepmind\nAdd us on Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepmind/",
