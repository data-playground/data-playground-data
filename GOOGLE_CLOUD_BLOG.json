        "description": "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Embeddings are a crucial component at the intersection of data and AI. As data structures, they encode the inherent meaning of the data they represent, and their significance becomes apparent when they are compared to one another. Vector search is a technique that uncovers the relative meaning of those embeddings by evaluating the distances between them within a shared space.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In early 2024, </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-new-vector-search-capabilities-in-bigquery?e=48754805\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">we launched vector search in the BigQuery data platform</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, making its powerful capabilities accessible to all BigQuery users. This effectively eliminated the need for specialized databases or complex AI workflows. Our ongoing efforts to democratize vector search has resulted in a unique approach that provides the scale, simplicity, and cost performance that BigQuery users expect. In this article, we reflect on the past two years, sharing insights gained from product development and customer interactions.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In the before-times: Building vector search the hard way\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Before we added native support for vector search in BigQuery, building a scalable vector search solution was a complex, multi-step process. Data professionals had to:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Extract data from their data warehouse</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Generate embeddings using specialized machine learning infrastructure</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Load the embeddings into a dedicated vector database</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Maintain this additional infrastructure, including server provisioning, scaling, and index management</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Develop custom pipelines to join vector search results back to their core business data</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Deal with downtime during index rebuilds, a critical pain point for production systems</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This disjointed, expensive, and high-maintenance architecture was a barrier to entry for many teams.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In the beginning: Focus on simplicity</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We kicked off BigQuery vector search with one goal: to make the simplest vector database on the market. We built it to meet some core design requirements:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">It needs to be fully serverless:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> We knew early on that the best way to bring vector search to all BigQuery customers was to make it serverless. We first built the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-index#create_an_ivf_vector_index\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">IVF index</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, combining the best of clustering and indexing, all within BigQuery. As a result, you don\u2019t need to provision </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">any new servers whatsoever</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to use vector search in BigQuery. This means you don't have to manage any underlying infrastructure for your vector database, freeing up your team to focus on what matters most: your data. BigQuery handles the scaling, maintenance, and reliability automatically. It can scale effortlessly to handle billions of embeddings, so your solution can grow with your business.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Index maintenance should be as simple as possible:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> BigQuery\u2019s vector indexes are a key part of this simplicity. You create an index with a simple </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_vector_index_statement\"><code style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">CREATE VECTOR INDEX</code></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> SQL statement, and BigQuery handles the rest. As new data is ingested, the index </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">automatically and asynchronously refreshes</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to reflect the changes. And if the ingested data results in data distribution changes in the dataset, and in turn, in search accuracy degradation, it\u2019s no problem: You can use the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-index#rebuild_a_vector_index\"><code style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Model Rebuild</code></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> feature to completely rebuild your index, without any index downtime, and with just one SQL statement.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">It should be integrated with GoogleSQL and Python:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> You can perform vector searches directly within your existing SQL workflows using a simple </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#vector_search\"><code style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">VECTOR_SEARCH</code></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> function. This makes it easy to combine semantic search with traditional queries and joins. For data scientists, the integration with Python and tools like </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">LangChain</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/use-bigquery-dataframes\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">BigQuery DataFrames</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> makes it a natural fit for building advanced machine learning applications.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Consistency needs to be guaranteed:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> New data is searchable via the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#vector_search\"><code style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">VECTOR_SEARCH</code></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> function immediately after ingestion, providing accuracy and consistency of the search results.\u00a0</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You only pay for what you use:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> The </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-search-intro#pricing\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">BigQuery vector search pricing model</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> is designed for flexibility. This \"pay as you go\" model is great for both ad-hoc analyses and highly price-performant batch queries. This model emphasizes the ease of trying out the feature without a significant upfront investment.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Security is a given:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> BigQuery\u2019s security infrastructure offers robust data -access control through </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/row-level-security-intro\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">row-level security</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> (RLS) and </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">column-level security</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> (CLS). This multi-layered approach guarantees that users can only access authorized data, thereby bolstering protection and ensuring compliance.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The early days: Growing with our customers</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As customers found success with early projects and moved more data into BigQuery, they told us about many data science workflows that they were \u201cupdating\u201d to use new embedding-based approaches. Here are a few examples of the various applications that vector search can enhance:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">LLM applications with retrieval augmented generation (RAG)</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: By providing relevant business data, vector search helps ensure accurate and grounded responses from large language models.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Semantic search on business data</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Enable powerful, natural-language search capabilities for both internal and external users. For instance, a marketing team could search for \"customers who have a similar purchasing history to Jane\" and receive a list of semantically similar customer profiles.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Customer 360 and deduplication</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Use embeddings to identify similar customer records, even if details like names or addresses differ slightly. This is an effective way to cleanse and consolidate data for a more accurate, single view of your customer.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Log analytics and anomaly detection</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Ingest log data as embeddings and use vector search to quickly find similar log entries, even if the exact text doesn't match. This helps security teams identify potential threats and anomalies much faster.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enhance product recommendations</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Suggest visually or textually similar items (e.g., clothing) or semantically related complementary products.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Where we are now: Improving scale and cost performance</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As customer usage grew, we enhanced our offering, observing significant demand for batch processing beyond RAG and generative AI workloads. Unlike traditional vector databases, improved batch vector search in BigQuery excels at high-throughput, analytical similarity searches on massive datasets. This allows data scientists to analyze billions of records simultaneously within their existing data environment, enabling previously prohibitive tasks such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Large-scale clustering:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Grouping every customer in a database based on their behavioral embeddings</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Comprehensive anomaly detection:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Finding the most unusual transaction for every single account in a financial ledger</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Bulk item categorization:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Classifying millions of text documents or product images simultaneously</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In the second phase of development, we launched many new features to further improve the vector search experience:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">TreeAH, built using the ScaNN index, provides significant product differentiation in price / performance. Our customers\u2019 data science teams were moving more of their recommendation, clustering, and data pipelines to use vector search. We saw great improvements using </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/introducing-scann-in-bigquery-vector-search-for-large-query-batches\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">TreeAH</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Various internal improvements to help increase the training and indexing performance and usability. For example, we added asynchronous index training, which increases usability and scalability as massive index training jobs are moved into the background. We also performed various internal optimizations to improve indexing performance, and reduce indexing latency without incurring additional costs for users.\u00a0</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-index#stored-columns\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Stored columns</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to help improve vector search performance:</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Users can apply prefilers on the stored columns in the vector search query to greatly optimize search performance without sacrificing search accuracy.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">If users only query stored columns in the vector search query, search performance can be further improved by avoiding expensive joins with the base table.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-index#partitions\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Partitioned indexes</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to dramatically reduce I/O costs and accelerate query performance by skipping irrelevant partitions. This is especially powerful for customers who frequently filter on partitioning columns, such as a date or region.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-index#rebuild_a_vector_index\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Index model rebuilds</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to help ensure that vector search results remain accurate and relevant over time. As your base data evolves, you can now proactively correct for model drift, maintaining the high performance of your vector search applications without index downtime.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Looking ahead: Indexing all the things</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As businesses look to agentic AI, the data platform has never been more important. We imagine a world in which every business has their own AI mode for productivity, and retrieving relevant data is at the heart of productivity, including intelligent indexing of all relevant enterprise data, structured or unstructured, to automate AI and analytics. Indexing and search is core to Google. We look forward to sharing relevant technology innovations with you!</span></p></div>",

With apps like </span><a href=\"https://www.facetuneapp.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoo8ZXXKPBsz1wyL8Rvq9ZtL65N9K51p_yyRjM1DoH6EqZ1oEkLQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Facetune</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, we saw the power of putting sophisticated editing tools directly into people's hands. When generative AI emerged, we knew it would fundamentally change content creation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We launched </span><a href=\"https://ltx.studio/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">LTX Studio</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to build generative video tools that truly serve the creative process. Many existing models felt like a \"prompt and pray\" experience, offering little control and long rendering times that stifled creativity. We needed to build our own models\u2014ones that were not only efficient but also gave creators the controllability they deserve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our initial success came from training our first real-time video generation model on </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Cloud TPUs </span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">with </span><a href=\"https://docs.pytorch.org/xla/release/r2.8/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">PyTorch/XLA</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.

After exploring optimization options, we decided to shift our approach. We paused development to rewrite our entire training codebase in JAX, and the results were immediate. Switching to JAX felt like a magic trick, instantly providing the necessary runtimes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This transition enabled us to effectively scale our tokens per sample (the amount of data processed in each training step), model parameters, and chip count. With JAX, sharding strategies (sharding divides large models across multiple chips) that previously failed now work out of the box on both small and large pods (clusters of TPU chips).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These changes delivered linear scaling that translates to 40% more training steps per day \u2014 directly accelerating model development and time to market.

AI agents help applications go from answering simple queries to performing complex, multi-step tasks to achieve the users objective. Provided a request like \u201cvisualize last quarters sales data\u201d, the agent has to use one tool to query the data and another to process that data into a graph and return to the user.\u00a0 Where traditional software is predictable, AI agents can make their own decisions about when and how to use tools at their disposal to achieve a user's objective, including generating code, using computer terminals and even browsers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Without strong security and operational guardrails, orchestrating powerful, non-deterministic agents can introduce significant risks. Providing kernel-level isolation for agents that execute code and commands is non-negotiable. AI and agent-based workloads also have additional infrastructure needs compared to traditional applications. Most notably, they need to orchestrate thousands of sandboxes as ephemeral environments, rapidly creating and deleting them as needed while ensuring they have limited network access.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">With its maturity, security, and scalability, we believe Kubernetes provides the most suitable foundation for running AI agents. Yet it still needs to evolve to meet the needs of agent code execution and computer use scenarios. Agent Sandbox is a powerful first step in that direction.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Strong isolation at scale</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Agentic code execution and computer use require an isolated sandbox to be provisioned for each task.

Foundationally built on gVisor with additional support for Kata Containers for runtime isolation, Agent Sandbox provides a secure boundary to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities that could lead to data loss, exfiltration or damage to production systems. We\u2019re continuing our commitment to open source, building Agent Sandbox as a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project in the Kubernetes community. </span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_K1VZDUQ.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enhanced performance on GKE</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">At the same time, you need to optimize performance as you scale your agents to deliver the best agent user-experience at the lowest cost.

Agent Sandbox also enables low-latency sandbox execution by enabling administrators to configure pre-warmed pools of sandboxes. With this feature, Agent Sandbox delivers sub-second latency for fully isolated agent workloads, up to a 90% improvement over cold starts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The same isolation property that makes a sandbox safe, makes it more susceptible to compute underutilization. Reinitializing each sandbox environment with a script can be brittle and slow, and idle sandboxes often waste valuable compute cycles. In a perfect world, you could take a snapshot of running sandbox environments to start them from a specific state.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Pod Snapshots</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> is a new, GKE-exclusive feature that enables full checkpoint and restore of running pods. Pod Snapshots drastically reduces startup latency of agent and AI workloads. When combined with Agent Sandbox, Pod Snapshots lets teams provision sandbox environments from snapshots, so they can start up in seconds. GKE Pod Snapshots supports snapshot and restore of both CPU- and GPU-based workloads, bringing pod start times from minutes down to seconds. With Pod Snapshots, any idle sandbox can be snapshotted and suspended, saving significant compute cycles with little to no disruption for end-users.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"2\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_NJWlanH.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Built for AI engineers</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Teams building today\u2019s agentic AI or reinforcement learning (RL) systems should not have to be infrastructure experts.

For businesses aiming to deliver personalized customer experiences and optimize operations, the choice of database technology is a critical decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">At Zeotap \u2014 a leading Customer Data Platform (CDP) \u2014 we empower enterprises to unify their data from disparate sources to build a comprehensive, unified view of their customers. This enables businesses to activate data across various channels for marketing, customer support, and analytics. Zeotap handles more than 10 billion new data points a day from more than 500 data sources across our clients, while orchestrating through more than 2000 workflows \u2014 one-third of those in real time with milliseconds latency. To meet stringent SLAs for data freshness and end-to-end latencies, performance is crucial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">However, as Zeotap grew, our ScyllaDB-based infrastructure faced scaling challenges, especially as the business needed to evolve towards real-time use cases and increasingly spiky workloads. We needed a more flexible, performant, cost-effective, and operationally efficient solution, which led us to </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Bigtable</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, a low-latency, NoSQL database service from Google Cloud for machine learning, operational analytics, and high-throughput applications. The migration resulted in significant benefits, including a 46% reduction in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge of scaling real-time analytics</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Zeotap's platform demands a database capable of handling a high write throughput of over 300,000 writes per second and nearly triple that in reads during peaks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As our platform evolved, the initial architecture presented several hurdles:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Scalability limitations:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> We initially self-managed ScyllaDB, on-prem, and later on in the cloud. We use Spark and BigQuery for analytical batch processing, but managing these different tools and pipelines across our own environment and customer environments reached a peak where scaling became increasingly harder.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Operational overhead:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Managing and scaling our previous database infrastructure required significant operational effort. We had to run scripts in the background to add nodes when resource alerts came up and had to map hardware to different kinds of workloads.\u00a0</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Deployment complexity:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Embedding third-party technology in our stack complicated deployment. The commercial procurement process was also cumbersome.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Cost predictability:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Ensuring predictable costs for us and our clients was a growing concern as our business grew.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These challenges drove us to re-evaluate our data infrastructure and seek a cloud-native solution that could meet our streaming first, \u201czero-touch\u201d ops philosophy, while supporting our demanding OLAP and OLTP workloads.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Why Bigtable? Performance, scalability, and efficiency</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Zeotap's decision to migrate to Bigtable was driven by four key requirements:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Operational simplicity:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Moving from ScyllaDB cluster to Bigtable meant eliminating a significant operational burden and achieving \"zero-touch ops\". Bigtable abstracts away hardware mapping and node management. This eliminates the need for maintenance windows and helps ensure data rebalancing.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Performance:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Zeotap needed predictable performance, even in the face of regularly unpredictable workloads to meet our stringent SLAs. Bigtable\u2019s ability to deliver low latencies for both reads and writes at scale was crucial \u2014 especially with spiky traffic patterns.\u00a0</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Efficient scalability:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Managing ScyllaDB cluster scaling, rebalancing, and hotspots was operationally intensive. Zeotap handles very spiky and bursty workloads at times exceeding 300,000 writes per second. Bigtable disaggregates compute and storage, allowing for rapid scaling (further enhanced by </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/autoscaling\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">autoscaling</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">), which automatically adjusts cluster size in response to demand. This lead to more cost efficiency and helped eliminate idle resources.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Total cost of ownership (TCO):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> A significant driver of this migration was the need for cost efficiency and predictability. By moving from ScyllaDB to Bigtable, we achieved a significant 46% reduction in our TCO. This stems from Bigtable's efficient storage and the ability to combine use cases, such as using Bigtable as a hot store and BigQuery as a warm store.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Tight integration:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Bigtable\u2019s integration with other Google Cloud services, particularly BigQuery, was a major advantage in reducing operational overhead. Features like </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/export-to-bigtable\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">reverse ETL</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> directly into Bigtable greatly simplifies data pipelines and reduces Zeotap\u2019s operational footprint by 20%.</span></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-aside\"><dl>\n    <dt>aside_block</dt>\n    <dd>&lt;ListValue: [StructValue([(&#x27;title&#x27;, &#x27;Build smarter with Google Cloud databases!&#x27;), (&#x27;body&#x27;, &lt;wagtail.rich_text.RichText object at 0x7f93ac305ee0&gt;), (&#x27;btn_text&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;), (&#x27;href&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;), (&#x27;image&#x27;, None)])]&gt;</dd>\n</dl></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Zeotap\u2019s architectural evolution to cloud-native\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Zeotap\u2019s transition to Bigtable wasn\u2019t an overnight lift-and-shift, but part of a strategic plan to build a streaming real-time analytics platform that could meet the needs of an evermore demanding customer landscape:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">2020</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: After running one of the largest graphs with JanusGraph-on-ScyllaDB and a heavy processing operation with Spark on AWS, we made the strategic move to migrate to Google Cloud.</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">2022</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Adopted a Lambda architecture, heavily pivoting into BigQuery, and moving away from graph due to performance issues.

        "description": "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming the crucial technique for aligning powerful models with human preferences and complex task objectives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">However, enterprises that need to implement and scale RL for LLMs are facing infrastructure challenges. The primary hurdles include the memory contention from concurrently hosting multiple large models (such as the actor, critic, reward, and reference models), iterative switching between high latency inference generation, and high throughput training phases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This blog details Google Cloud's full-stack, integrated approach, from custom TPU hardware to the GKE orchestration layer \u2014 and shares how you can solve the hybrid, high-stakes demands of RL at scale.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A quick primer: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for LLMs</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">RL is a continuous feedback loop that combines elements of both training and inference. At a high level, the RL loop for LLMs functions as follows:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The LLM generates a response to a given prompt.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A \"reward model\" (often trained on human preferences) assigns a quantitative score, or reward, to the output.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">An RL algorithm (e.g., DPO, GRPO) uses this reward signal to update the LLM's parameters, adjusting its policy to generate higher-rewarding outputs in subsequent interactions.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This generation, evaluation, and optimization continually improves the LLM's performance based on predefined objectives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">RL workloads are hybrid and cyclical. The main goal of RL is not to minimize error (training) or fast prediction (inference), but to maximize reward through iterative interaction. The primary constraint for the RL workload is not just the computational power, but also system-wide efficiency, specifically minimizing aggregate sampler latency and maximizing the speed of weight copying for efficient end-to-end step time.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Cloud's full-stack approach to RL</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Solving these system-wide challenges requires an integrated approach. You can't just have fast hardware or a good orchestrator; you need every layer of the stack to work together. Here is how our full-stack approach is built to solve the specific demands of RL:</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">1. Flexible, high-performance compute (TPUs and GPUs):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Instead of locking customers into one path, we provide two high-performance options. Our </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">TPU stack</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> is a vertically integrated, JAX-native solution where our custom hardware (excelling at matrix operations) is co-designed with our post-training libraries (MaxText and Tunix). In parallel, we fully support the </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">NVIDIA GPU ecosystem</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, partnering with NVIDIA on optimized NeMo RL recipes so customers can leverage their existing expertise directly on GKE.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">2. Holistic, full-stack optimization:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> We integrate optimization from the bare metal up. This includes our custom TPU accelerators, high-throughput storage (Managed Lustre, Google Cloud Storage), and \u2014 critically \u2014 the orchestration and scheduling that GKE provides. By optimizing the entire stack, we can attack the </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">system-wide</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> latencies that bottleneck hybrid RL workloads.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">3. Leadership in open-source:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> RL infrastructure is complex and built on a wide range of tools. Our leadership starts with open-sourcing Kubernetes and extends to active partnerships with orchestrators like Ray. We contribute to key projects like vLLM, develop open-source solutions like llm-d for cost-effective serving, and open-source our own high-performance MaxText and Tunix libraries. This helps ensure you can integrate the best tools for the job, not just the ones from a single vendor.</span></p>\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">4. Proven, mega-scale orchestration:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Post-training RL can require compute resources that rival pre-training. This requires an orchestration layer that can manage massive, distributed jobs as a single unit. GKE AI mega-clusters support up to 65,000 nodes today, and we are heavily investing in multi-cluster solutions like MultiKueue to scale RL workloads beyond the limits of a single cluster.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Running RL workloads on GKE</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Existing GKE infrastructure is well-suited for demanding RL workloads and provides several infrastructure-level efficiencies.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The image below outlines the architecture and key recommendations for implementing RL at scale. </span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_HnbQkXW.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure : GKE infrastructure for running RL</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">At the base, the infrastructure layer provides the foundational hardware, including supported compute types (CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs). You can use the Run:ai model streamer to accelerate the model streaming for all three compute types. High performance storage (Managed Lustre, Cloud Storage) can be used for storage needs for RL.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The middle layer is the managed K8s layer powered by GKE, which handles the resource orchestration, resource obtainability using Spot or Dynamic Workload Scheduler, autoscaling, placement, job queuing and job scheduling and more at mega scale.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, the open frameworks layer runs on top of GKE, providing the application and execution environment. This includes the managed support for open-source tools such as KubeRay, Slurm and gVisor sandbox for secure isolated task execution.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Building RL workflow</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Before creating an RL workload, you must first identify a clear use case. With that objective defined, you then architect the core components: selecting the algorithm (e.g, DPO, GRPO), the model server (like vLLM or SGLang), the target GPU/TPU hardware, and other critical configurations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Next, you can provision a GKE cluster configured with Workload Identity, GCS Fuse, and DGCM metrics. For robust batch processing, install the Kueue and JobSet APIs. We recommend deploying Ray as the orchestrator on top of this GKE stack. From there, you can launch the Nemo RL container, configure it for your GRPO job, and begin monitoring its execution.

This means you might find the same feedback on new pull requests that you\u2019ve rejected before, because the agent can't learn from your team's guidance, leading to frustration and repeated work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Today, we\u2019re releasing a new memory capability for </span><a href=\"https://codeassist.google/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Gemini Code Assist</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> on GitHub for both enterprises and individual developers. Now, you can create a dynamic, evolving memory of your team's coding standards, style, and best practices, all derived from your direct interactions and feedback within pull requests. The memory is stored securely in a Google-managed project specific to your installation, isolating it from other users.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Here's how memory works</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Memory transforms the code review agent from a stateless tool into a long-term project contributor that learns and adapts to your team.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Automated vs. manual memory</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Gemini Code Assist on GitHub already supports memory in the form of styleguide.md files. These rules are always added to the agent's prompt, which makes it suitable for static, universal guidelines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In contrast, persistent memory introduces a more dynamic and automated approach. It automatically extracts rules from pull request interactions, requiring no manual effort. These learned rules are stored efficiently and are only retrieved and applied when they are relevant to the specific code being reviewed. This creates a smarter, more scalable memory that adapts to your team\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The process is built on three key pillars:</span></p>\n<h4><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">1. It learns from your interactions</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The process begins when you and your team do what you already do today - conducting code reviews: When a pull request is merged, Gemini Code Assist on GitHub will analyze the comment threads for feedback. For instance, if Gemini Code Assist on GitHub points out that \u201c</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">do not line-wrap import statements</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\u201d in a .java file, and the author disagrees in their comment, the agent sees this interaction as a valuable piece of feedback and will store it. By waiting until a PR is merged, we ensure the conversation is complete and the code is a valuable source of truth.</span></p>\n<h4><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">2. It intelligently creates, updates and stores rules</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">From that simple interaction, persistent memory uses the powerful Gemini model to infer a generalized, reusable rule. In the example above, it would generate a natural language rule like: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">\"In Java, </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">import statements could be </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">line-wrapped</span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">\u201d.</span></p>\n<h4><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">3.

        "description": "<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p>Google Public Sector is committed to supporting the critical missions of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) by delivering cutting-edge cloud, AI, and data services securely. Today, we are marking an important milestone in that commitment: we have successfully achieved Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Level 2 certification under the DoD\u2019s CMMC program.</p><p>This certification, validated by a certified third-party assessment organization (C3PAO), affirms that Google Public Sector\u2019s internal systems used to handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) meet the DoD\u2019s rigorous cybersecurity standards for protecting CUI.</p><h3><b>Enabling a secure partnership</b></h3><p>This CMMC Level 2 certification is a key enabler for our partnership with the DoD. It ensures our teams can operate and collaborate within the defense ecosystem fully supporting the new DoD requirements, allowing us to serve as a trusted partner and support the mission without compromise.</p><h3><b>Helping the Defense Industrial Base on their CMMC journey</b></h3><p>While this certification does not extend to customer environments, we are also dedicated to helping our partners and customers across the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) on their <i>own</i> CMMC journeys.</p><p>Our FedRAMP-authorized cloud services, including Google Workspace, are designed to support DIB suppliers in building their CMMC-compliant solutions with secure, cutting-edge cloud, AI, and data capabilities. You can find all of our compliance resources, including guides for both Google Cloud and Google Workspace, on our central<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/cmmc\"> CMMC compliance page</a>. As an example, our<a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/helpcenter/gws_implementation_guide_for_cmmc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Google Workspace CMMC Implementation Guide</a> provides specific configuration details and control mappings and our recent blog details how <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/blog/identity-and-security/checkboxes-checkmates-how-google-workspace-can-help-you-achieve-cmmc-20-compliance?e=48754805\" target=\"_blank\">Google Workspace can help you achieve CMMC 2.0 compliance</a>. These resources are designed to help DIB companies accelerate their own assessments and build their CMMC-compliant solutions on a secure, verified foundation.</p><h3><b>Understanding CMMC and the DFARS connection</b></h3><p>The CMMC program is a DoD initiative to enhance cybersecurity across the DIB. Its purpose is to verify that contractors have implemented the required security controls, based heavily on NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171, to protect CUI and Federal Contract Information (FCI).</p><p>Many contractors are already familiar with DFARS 252.204-7012, which has long required the implementation of NIST SP 800-171. The new CMMC program is being implemented into contracts via the clause DFARS 252.204-7021. When this clause appears in a solicitation, it makes having achieved a specific CMMC level a mandatory condition for contract award.</p><h3><b>A continued commitment to the mission</b></h3><p>Our CMMC Level 2 certification is a direct reflection of our commitment to meeting the DoD's stringent security requirements. It ensures we can continue to support the Department\u2019s mission responsibly and compliantly. We remain committed to our partnership with the DoD, empowering the Defense Industrial Base with cutting-edge cloud, AI, and data services to build a more secure and resilient future.</p><p>Catch the highlights from our recent <a href=\"https://cloudonair.withgoogle.com/events/public-sector-summit-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Google Public Sector Summit</a> where we shared how Google Cloud\u2019s AI and security technologies can help advance your mission.</p></div>",

The EOE made one thing clear: to succeed,</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">data had to be at the core of everything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This realization led Ericsson to develop its first enterprise data strategy, which established the core principles for how data is collected, managed and governed. However, building a strategy is one thing \u2014 operationalizing it at scale is another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To move beyond theory to address real-world challenges, Ericsson needed to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Build trust:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Provide discoverable, clean, reliable, and well-understood data to the teams deploying analytics, AI, and automation.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Balance defense and offense:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Ensure compliance with contracts and regulations (defensive governance) while empowering teams to innovate and create value from data (offensive governance).</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ensure data integrity: </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ericsson users see data integrity as the core principle for effective data management. Data quality, which is essential for reliable, trustworthy data throughout its lifecycle, is a key quality indicator (KQI) for measuring effectiveness. Any quality deviations must be managed like a high-priority incident with clear Service Level Agreements (SLA) for restoration and resolution.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To realize this vision, Ericsson sought a platform that could match its ambition for global-scale governance and innovation \u2014 and Dataplex Universal Catalog emerged as the ideal choice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ericsson made its selection based on four key criteria.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">First, its capabilities aligned perfectly with Ericsson\u2019s requirements for cloud-native transformation, business principles, and a long-term governance vision, underpinned by Ericsson\u2019s strategic partnership with Google Cloud. Second, from a technical standpoint, Dataplex provided a tightly integrated, end-to-end ecosystem as a native Google Cloud solution, translating to faster time-to-market for use cases and reduced integration overhead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Third, the platform offered a practical operating model that enabled quick learning, adaptation, and self-sufficiency, supporting an agile approach where Ericsson could fail fast and iterate. Finally, as an existing Google Cloud customer, Dataplex presented a clear and manageable Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), serving as a natural extension of Ericsson\u2019s existing environment and providing a clear, manageable cost profile for both storage and compute extension with governance capabilities.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Putting governance into practice: Key capabilities in action</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">With Dataplex Universal Catalog as the governance foundation, Ericsson began implementing the core pillars of its governance program, moving from manual processes to an automated, intelligent data fabric.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">More specifically, Ericsson established a unified business vocabulary within Dataplex. This transformative first step eliminated ambiguity and ensured their teams \u2014 from data scientists to data analysts \u2014 were speaking the same language. These glossaries also captured tribal knowledge and became the foundation for creating trusted data products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In addition, Dataplex's catalog is at the heart of the data governance solution, making data discovery simple and intuitive for authorized users. Ericsson uses its tagging capabilities to enrich the data assets with critical metadata, including data classification, ownership, retention policies, and sensitivity labels. Dataplex\u2019s ability to automatically visualize data lineage, down to the column level, is another game-changer. Different data personas can instantly understand a dataset's origin and its downstream impact, dramatically increasing trust and reducing investigation time. </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Furthermore, trustworthy AI models are built on high-quality data. For proactive data quality, Ericsson uses Dataplex to run automated quality checks and profiles on its data pipelines. When a quality rule is breached, an alert is automatically triggered, creating an incident in its service management platform to ensure data issues are treated with the urgency they deserve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These capabilities are all underpinned by Ericsson's</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Data Operating Model (DOM), a framework that defines the policies, people, processes, and technology needed to translate its data strategy into tangible value, comprising several facets when working with data.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_nGFHVwm.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><ol>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enterprise data architecture:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Managing data flow, enterprise data modeling and best practices for data collection till consumption</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Technology and tools</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Business glossary, master, reference and metadata management, data modeling, and data quality management</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Roles and responsibilities:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Roles to manage and govern data (i.e., end-to-end data lifecycle and stewardship)</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Data and model assurance:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Data pipelines monitoring, data observability, and data quality monitoring</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Governance: </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Manage data compliance, risk and security management, managing operational level agreement, objective and key results, and audit management</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Processes:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Data governance, data quality, data management, and data consent related processes</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Looking ahead: The future is integrated and intelligent</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As a global technology leader, Ericsson is committed to shaping the future of AI-powered data governance. Technology, especially in the AI space, is evolving at a breathtaking pace and both the data and AI governance practices must keep up.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These developments are guiding Ericsson\u2019s future priorities, which include bridging the gap between data and AI governance, especially with the rise of generative and agentic AI. These plans include evaluating using generative AI capabilities in BigQuery and Dataplex to simplify governance and pursuing solutions that ensure transparency, explainability, fairness and manage risk in the deployment of AI models.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In addition to harnessing the power of AI for at-scale governance, Ericsson will also include usage of governance workflows, glossary-driven data quality policies, at-scale assignment of terms to assets, bulk import and export of glossaries, AI-powered glossary recommendations, and data quality re-usability functionalities. Ericsson is also aligning its architecture with data fabric and data mesh principles, empowering teams with self-service access to high-quality, trusted data products.</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, Ericsson will be assessing the use of more granular, policy-based access controls to complement existing role-based access, further strengthening its data security, protection and privacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">For any organization embarking on a similar path, Ericsson\u2019s experience offers several key lessons:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Governance is a value enabler, not a blocker:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> A modern data governance program is focused on business enablement first, driving value and innovation, to complement policies, rules and risk management.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">It's a journey, not a destination:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Be prepared to fail fast, learn, and adapt. The landscape is constantly changing at breakneck speed.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Focus on business outcomes, not tools:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Technology is a critical enabler, but the conversation is about the business value you\u2019re creating. Simplify the story, speak the language of the business, and unpack the hype.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Culture is everything:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> For governance to be effective, it\u2019s the responsibility of everyone. This requires strong leadership, sponsorship, and a \"data-first\" mindset embedded throughout the organization.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By partnering with Google Cloud and tapping into the power of Dataplex Universal Catalog, Ericsson is building a data foundation that is not only compliant and secure but agile and intelligent \u2014 ready to power the next generation of autonomous networks.</span></p></div>",

While you can generate embeddings out of the box for in line search use cases, we also wanted AlloyDB to address the complexity of creating and maintaining huge numbers of vector embeddings.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To make this possible, we\u2019re introducing two new features for AlloyDB AI, available in preview, that will empower you to transform your existing operational database into a powerful, AI-native database with just a few lines of SQL:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Auto vector embeddings</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Auto vector index</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/ai/generate-manage-auto-embeddings-for-tables\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Auto vector embeddings</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> transform operational data into vector search ready data by vectorizing data stored inside of AlloyDB at scale. The </span><a href=\"https://docs.cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/ai/create-scann-index#create-scann-index-automatic\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">auto vector index</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> self-configures vector indexes optimized for customer\u2019s workloads, ensuring high quality and performance.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Compare this to the traditional approach of creating the vectors and loading them into your database. The basic steps are familiar to any AI developer: generate vector embeddings using specialized AI models, import the vectors into the database alongside the underlying text, and tune vector indexes. In other words, build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, extract the data from your database, apply transformations, run it through the AI model, reload and reformat it, then reinsert it into your database and then tune the vector indexes. This approach not only involves significant engineering complexity but also introduces latency, making it difficult to keep your application in sync with your live data despite it being stored alongside it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">An additional challenge is to keep the vector index up to date, which is hard to do manually. While manually tuned indexes are performant and provide excellent results, they can be sensitive to updates in the underlying data and require performance and quality testing before they\u2019re ready to hit the road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Let's walk through an example journey of an operational workload and see how AlloyDB AI\u2019s new features remove friction from building enterprise-grade AI, and enable users to modernize applications from their database.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AlloyDB as a vector database</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Imagine you run a large e-commerce platform with a </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">products</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> table in AlloyDB, containing structured data like </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">product_id</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">color</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">price</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, and </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">inventory_count</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, alongside unstructured data such as </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">product_description</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You want to build a gen AI search feature to improve the quality of search in your application and make it more dynamic and personalized for users.

This cache, crucial for speeding up LLM inference by storing Key (K) and Value (V) matrices, directly impacts context length, concurrency, and overall system throughput. Our primary goal is to maximize the KV Cache hit ratio by intelligently expanding NVIDIA GPU High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with a tiered node-local storage solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our collaboration with the LMCache team (Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, and Yihua Cheng from Tensormesh) has led to the development of an innovative solution on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">T</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">iered Storage: Expanding the KV Cache Beyond HBM</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">LMCache extends the KV Cache from the NVIDIA GPU's fast HBM (Tier 1) to larger, more cost-effective tiers like CPU RAM and local SSDs. This dramatically increases the total cache size, leading to a higher hit ratio and improved inference performance by keeping more data locally on the accelerator node. For GKE users, this means accommodating models with massive context windows while maintaining excellent performance.</span></p>\n<h2><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Performance Benchmarking and Results</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We designed tests to measure the performance of this tiered KV Cache by configuring workloads to fill each storage layer (HBM, CPU RAM, Local SSD).

Partitioning your vector index significantly reduces query costs and improves search accuracy for vector searches that utilize pre-filtering on the partitioning column.By partitioning your vector index, BigQuery can apply partition pruning to both your table and your vector index when you use a filter on the partitioning column in your vector search. This means BigQuery only scans the relevant partitions, decreasing I/O costs. Additionally, pre-filtering on the partitioning column makes your vector searches less likely to miss relevant results. This feature is particularly beneficial if most of your vector searches target specific partitions using pre-filters.

This blog details the core components of Google's AI software stack that are woven into Ironwood, demonstrating how this deep co-design unlocks performance, efficiency, and scale. We cover the JAX and PyTorch ecosystems, the XLA compiler, and the high-level frameworks that make this power accessible.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">1. The co-designed foundation</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Foundation models today have trillions of parameters that require computation at ultra-large scale. We designed the Ironwood stack from the silicon up to meet this challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The core philosophy behind the Ironwood stack is system-level co-design, treating the entire TPU pod not as a collection of discrete accelerators, but as a single, cohesive supercomputer. This architecture is built on a custom interconnect that enables massive-scale Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), allowing thousands of chips to exchange data directly at high bandwidth and low latency, bypassing the host CPU. Ironwood has a total of 1.77 PB of directly accessible HBM capacity, where each chip has eight stacks of HBM3E, with a peak HBM bandwidth of 7.4 TB/s and capacity of 192 GiB.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Unlike general-purpose parallel processors,TPUs are Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built for one purpose: accelerating large-scale AI workloads. The deep integration of compute, memory, and networking is the foundation of their performance. At a high level, the TPU consists of two parts:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Hardware core</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: The TPU core is centered around a dense</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Matrix Multiply Unit (MXU)</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> for matrix operations, complemented by a powerful </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Vector Processing Unit (VPU)</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> for element-wise operations (activations, normalizations) and </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">SparseCores</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> for scalable embedding lookups. This specialized hardware design is what delivers Ironwood's 42.5 Exaflops of FP8 compute.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Software target</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: This hardware design is explicitly targeted by the </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA) compiler</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, using a software co-design philosophy that </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">combines the broad benefits of whole-program optimization with the precision of hand-crafted custom kernels. </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">XLA's compiler-centric approach provides a powerful performance baseline by fusing operations into optimized kernels that saturate the MXU and VPU. This approach delivers good \"out of the box\" performance with broad framework and model support. This general-purpose optimization is then complemented by custom kernels </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">(detailed below in the Pallas section)</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to achieve peak performance on specific model-hardware combinations.

Pallas presents a unified, Python-first experience, dramatically reducing cognitive load and accelerating the iteration cycle. Other platforms lack this unified, in-Python approach, forcing developers to fragment their workflow. To optimize these operations, they must drop into a disparate ecosystem of lower-level tools\u2014from DSLs like Triton and cuTE to raw CUDA C++ and PTX. This introduces significant mental overhead by forcing developers to manually manage memory, streams, and kernel launches, pulling them out of their Python-based environment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This is a clear example of co-design.

Since 2006, the platform has helped more than a million users globally simplify business management, track financials, and improve communication. To support this massive scale and their ambitious vision, they rely on a robust technology stack on Google Cloud, including, recently, Memorystore for Valkey. Read on to hear about their migration from Memorystore for Redis to the new platform.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Running a construction business is a complex balancing act that requires a constant stream of real-time information to keep projects on track. At </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Buildertrend, </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">we understand the challenges our customers face \u2014 from fluctuating material costs and supply chain delays to managing tight deadlines and the risk of budget overruns \u2014 and work to help construction professionals improve efficiency, reduce risk, and enhance collaboration, all while growing their bottom line.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge: Caching at scale</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The construction industry has historically been slow to adopt new technologies, hindering efficiency and scalability. At Buildertrend, we aim to change this by being at the forefront of adopting new technology. When </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-general-availability-of-memorystore-for-valkey\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Memorystore for Valkey became generally available</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, we spent time looking into whether it could help us modernize our stack and deliver value to customers. We were attracted by Valkey's truly open source posture and its promised performance benefits over competing technologies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Before adopting Memorystore for Valkey, we had used Memorystore for Redis. While it served our basic needs, we found ourselves hitting a wall when it came to a critical feature: native cross-regional replication. As we scaled, we needed a solution that could support a global user base and provide seamless failover in case of a disaster or other issues within a region. We also needed a modern connectivity model such as Google Cloud\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Private Service Connect</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to enhance network security and efficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As a fully managed, scalable, and highly available in-memory data store, Memorystore for Valkey offered the key features we needed out of the box to take our platform to the next level.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A modern solution for a modern problem</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Within this ecosystem, we use Memorystore for Valkey for a variety of critical functions, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Database-backed cache:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Speeds up data retrieval for a faster user experience</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Session state:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Manages user sessions for web applications</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Job storage:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Handles asynchronous task queues for background processes</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Pub/Sub idempotency keys:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Ensures messages are processed exactly once, preventing data duplication</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Authentication tokens</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Securely validates user identity with cryptographically signed tokens, enabling fast, scalable authentication</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By leveraging the cache in these scenarios, our application is fast, resilient, and ready to meet the demands of our growing customer base. The native cross regional replication helped us support a global user base without having to worry about keeping global caches in sync.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A seamless migration with minimal disruption</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Migrating from Memorystore for Redis to Memorystore for Valkey was a smooth process, thanks to close collaboration with the Google Cloud team. We worked with the Google Cloud team to identify the best approach, which for us involved exporting data to Google Cloud Storage and seeding the data at Valkey instance creation, allowing us to migrate with minimal downtime. Because Memorystore for Valkey natively supports Private Service Connect, we were able to eliminate a proxy layer that our engineers used to connect to our Memorystore for Redis instances, simplifying our stack and improving our networking posture.</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Looking ahead to a global future</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Although it's still early in our journey, the impact is already clear. Memorystore for Valkey has unlocked our ability to scale and drastically reduced our time to market. It has allowed our team to streamline and own deployment processes, so they can be more agile and responsive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">For us, the future is about global scalability. With nearly 300 Memorystore for Valkey instances in our fleet, we're building a globally available, cloud-native stack. Our most critical instances are highly optimized to serve up to 30,000 requests per second each, demonstrating the foundation's scalability and performance.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We strive to use scalable cloud-native technologies, and Memorystore for Valkey will enable us to continue down this path. By using the Memorystore for Valkey managed service, we not only solve technical problems, but also accelerate business growth and empower engineering teams to focus on what matters most: </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">building great products</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ready to build with Memorystore for Valkey?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Like Buildertrend, you can leverage the power of a fully managed, scalable, and highly available in-memory data store to accelerate your applications and empower your development teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">To get started, explore the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/valkey\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Memorystore for Valkey documentation</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\"> and sign up for a Google Cloud account!</span></p></div>",

Although some recent implementations of novel AI techniques are experimental, they provide an early indicator of how threats are evolving and how they can potentially integrate AI capabilities into future intrusion activity. Attackers are moving beyond \"vibe coding\" and the baseline observed in 2024 of using AI tools for technical support. We are only now starting to see this type of activity, but expect it to increase in the future.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><div align=\"left\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\"><table><colgroup><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Malware</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Function</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Description</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Status</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f8f5e0440c57c7deffd75ca33e2511867039796aa803e7ef847396a379188a7d\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">FRUITSHELL</span></a></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Reverse Shell</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Publicly available reverse shell written in PowerShell that establishes a remote connection to a configured command-and-control server and allows a threat actor to execute arbitrary commands on a compromised system.

PROMPTFLUX is written in VBScript and interacts with Gemini's API to request specific VBScript obfuscation and evasion techniques to facilitate \"just-in-time\" self-modification, likely to evade static signature-based detection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Further examination of PROMPTFLUX samples suggests this code family is currently in a development or testing phase since some incomplete features are commented out and a mechanism exists to limit the malware's Gemini API calls. The current state of this malware does not demonstrate an ability to compromise a victim network or device. We have taken action to disable the assets</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">associated with this activity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The most novel component of PROMPTFLUX is its \"Thinking Robot\" module, designed to periodically query Gemini to obtain new code for evading antivirus software. This is accomplished using a hard-coded API key to send a POST request to the Gemini API endpoint. The actor specifies the use of the \"</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">gemini-1.5-flash-latest</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\" model; the \"</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">-latest</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\" tag ensures the malware always calls the most current stable release, making the tool more resilient to model deprecation. The prompt sent to the LLM is highly specific and machine-parsable, requesting VBScript code for antivirus evasion and instructing the LLM to output only the code itself.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Although the self-modification function (</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AttemptToUpdateSelf</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">) is commented out, its presence, combined with the active logging of AI responses to \"</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">%TEMP%\\thinking_robot_log.txt</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\", clearly indicates the author's goal of creating a metamorphic script that can evolve over time.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"VBS &quot;StartThinkingRobot&quot; function\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/misuse-of-ai-two-fig1.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure 1: VBS \"StartThinkingRobot\" function</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We identified multiple variations of PROMPTFLUX using LLM-driven code regeneration, including one with the \"Thinking Robot\" function replaced with a new \"Thinging\" function. This function leverages a prompt to instruct the Gemini API to rewrite the malware's entire source code on an hourly basis to evade detection. The prompt directs the LLM to act as an \"expert VBScript obfuscator,\" ensuring the new variant remains viable by embedding the original decoy payload, the hard-coded API key, and the complete self-regeneration logic, thereby establishing a recursive cycle of mutation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Although unattributed to a specific threat actor, the filenames associated with PROMPTFLUX highlight behaviors commonly associated with financially motivated actors.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has observed threat actors moving beyond using AI solely for productivity gains: They\u2019re experimenting with <b>deploying novel AI-enabled malware in active operations</b>.</p><p>This shift marks a new phase in how threat actors use AI, shifting from experimentation to wider takeup of tools. It follows our analysis on the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/adversarial-misuse-generative-ai\">adversarial misuse of generative AI</a>, where we found that, up until the point when we published the report in January, threat actors were using Gemini mostly for productivity gains.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6\n      h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n      <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n        <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">At Google, we are committed to developing AI responsibly and are taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity, disabling the projects and accounts associated with these threat actors.</q>\n\n        \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p>Based on GTIG\u2019s unique visibility into the misuse of AI tools and the broader threat landscape, the new report details four key findings on how government-backed threat actors and cybercriminals are integrating AI across their entire attack lifecycle. By understanding how adversaries are innovating with AI, security leaders can get ahead of threats and take proactive measures to update their security posture against a changing threat landscape.</p><p><b>1. AI generating commands to steal documents and data</b></p><p>For the first time, GTIG has identified malware families that use large language models (LLMs) during execution. These tools can dynamically generate malicious scripts, use self-modification to obfuscate their own code to evade detection, and receive commands from AI models rather than traditional command-and-control (C2) servers.</p><p>One such new malware detailed in the full report is a data miner we track as PROMPTSTEAL. In June, GTIG identified the Russian government-backed actor APT28 (also known as FROZENLAKE) using PROMPTSTEAL, which masquerades as an image generation program that guides the user through a series of prompts to generate images.</p><p>In the background, PROMPSTEAL queries the API for Hugging Face, a platform for open-source machine learning including LLMs, to generate commands for execution, rather than hard-coding commands in the malware. The prompt specifically asks the LLM to output commands to gather system information, to copy documents to a specified directory, and to exfiltrate data.</p><p>Our analysis indicates continued development of this malware, with new samples adding obfuscation and changing the C2 method.</p><p>FROZENLAKE\u2019s use of PROMPTSTEAL constitutes <b>our first observation of malware querying a LLM deployed in live operations</b>. Combined with other recent experimental implementations of novel AI techniques, this campaign provides an early indicator of how threats are evolving and how adversaries can potentially integrate AI capabilities into future intrusion activity.</p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with their activity. Google DeepMind has also used these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse by strengthening both Google\u2019s classifiers and the model itself. This enables the model to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>2. Social engineering to bypass safeguards</b></p><p>Threat actors have been adopting social engineering pretexts in their prompts to bypass AI safeguards. We observed actors posing as cybersecurity researchers and as students in capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions to persuade Gemini to provide information that would otherwise receive a safety response from Gemini.</p><p>In one interaction, a threat actor asked Gemini to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system, but received a safety response from Gemini that a detailed response would not be safe. They reframed the prompt by depicting themselves as a participant in a CTF exercise, and in response Gemini returned helpful information that could be misused to exploit the system.</p><p>The threat actor appeared to learn from this interaction and continued to use the CTF pretext over several weeks in support of phishing, exploitation, and webshell development.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: We took action against the CTF threat actor by disabling the assets associated with the actor\u2019s activity. Google DeepMind was able to use these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>3. Maturing cybercrime marketplace for AI tooling</b></p><p>In addition to misusing mainstream AI-enabled tools and services, there is a growing interest and marketplace for purpose-built AI tools and services that can enable illicit activities. To identify evolving threats, GTIG tracks posts and advertisements on underground forums related to AI tools and services as well as discussions surrounding the technology.</p><p>Many underground forum advertisements mirror language comparable to marketing for legitimate AI models, citing the need to improve the efficiency of workflows and effort while simultaneously offering guidance for prospective customers interested in their offerings.</p><p>The underground marketplace for illicit AI tools has matured in 2025. GTIG has <a href=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1762840/episodes/17689432-ai-tools-and-sentiment-within-the-underground-cyber-crime-community\" target=\"_blank\">identified multiple offerings</a> of multifunctional tools designed to support phishing, malware development, vulnerability research, and other capabilities. This development has lowered the barrier to entry for less sophisticated, poorly-resourced threat actors.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: While there are no direct mitigations to prevent threat actors from developing their own AI tools, at Google we <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-google-does-it-threat-intelligence-uncover-track-cybercrime?e=48754805\">use threat intelligence to disrupt adversary operations</a> \u2014 including monitoring the cybercrime AI tool marketplace.</p><p><b>4. Continued augmentation of the full attack lifecycle</b></p><p>State-sponsored actors from North Korea, Iran, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) continue to misuse AI to enhance all stages of their operations, from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to C2 development and data exfiltration.</p><p>In one example, GTIG observed a suspected PRC-nexus actor using Gemini to support multiple stages of an intrusion campaign, including conducting initial reconnaissance on targets, researching phishing techniques to deliver payloads, soliciting assistance from Gemini related to lateral movement, seeking technical support for C2 efforts once inside a victim\u2019s system, and helping with data exfiltration.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: GTIG takes a holistic, intelligence-driven approach to detecting and disrupting threat activity. Our understanding of government-backed threat actors and their campaigns can help provide the needed context to identify threat-enabling activity. By tracking this activity, we\u2019re able to leverage our insights to counter threats across Google platforms, including disrupting the activity of threat actors who have misused Gemini.</p><p>Our learnings from countering malicious activities are fed back into our product development to improve safety and security for our AI models. Google DeepMind was able to use these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>Building AI safely and responsibly</b></p><p>At Google, we are committed to developing AI responsibly and are taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity, disabling the projects and accounts associated with these threat actors. In addition to taking action against accounts, we have proactively fed the intelligence back into our teams and products to better protect Google and its users. We continuously improve our models to make them less susceptible to misuse, and share our findings to arm defenders and enable stronger protections across the ecosystem.</p><p>We believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges. Guided by our <a href=\"https://ai.google/responsibility/responsible-ai-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">AI Principles</a>, Google designs AI systems with robust security measures and strong safety guardrails, and we <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advancing-geminis-security-safeguards/\" target=\"_blank\">continuously test</a> the security and safety of our models to improve them.</p><p>For more on these shifting behaviors, along with the steps we\u2019ve taken to thwart these efforts, you can read <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actor-usage-of-ai-tools\">GTIG AI Threat Tracker: Advances in Threat Actor Usage of AI Tools here</a>.</p></div>\n<div class=\"block-aside\"><dl>\n    <dt>aside_block</dt>\n    <dd>&lt;ListValue: [StructValue([(&#x27;title&#x27;, &#x27;Tell us what you think&#x27;), (&#x27;body&#x27;, &lt;wagtail.rich_text.RichText object at 0x7fe16cf37340&gt;), (&#x27;btn_text&#x27;, &#x27;Join the conversation&#x27;), (&#x27;href&#x27;, &#x27;https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2n82k0LeG4upS2q&#x27;), (&#x27;image&#x27;, &lt;GAEImage: GCAT-replacement-logo-A&gt;)])]&gt;</dd>\n</dl></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><h3><b>In case you missed it</b></h3><p>Here are the latest updates, products, services, and resources from our security teams so far this month:</p><ul><li><b>How Google Does It: Threat modeling, from basics to AI</b>: Threat modeling plays a critical role at Google in how we detect and respond to threats \u2014 and secure our use of the public cloud. <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-google-does-it-threat-modeling-from-basics-to-ai/\"><b>Read more</b></a>.</li><li><b>How rapid threat models inject more reality into tabletops</b>: Using rapid threat models in tabletop exercises can help you better understand how defense should adapt to the dynamic threat environment. <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-rapid-threat-models-inject-more-reality-into-tabletops/\"><b>Read more</b></a>.</li><li><b>How we're helping customers prepare for a quantum-safe future</b>: Google has been working on quantum-safe computing for nearly a decade.

Better yet, we recently slashed the cost of using Workload Manager by up to 95% for certain scenarios, letting you run large-scale scans more economically, including a small free tier to help you run small-scale tests. In this blog, we show you how to get started with automated financial governance policies in Workload Manager, so you can stop playing catch-up and start proactively managing your cloud spend.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge with manual FinOps</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Managing business-critical workloads in the cloud is complex. Staying on top of cost-control best practices is a significant and time-consuming effort. Manual reviews and audits can take weeks or even months to complete, by which time costs can spiral. This manual approach often leads to \"configuration drift,\" where systems deviate from your established cost management policies, making it difficult to detect and control spending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Workload Manager helps you break free from these manual constraints by providing a framework for automated, continuous validation, helping FinOps teams to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Improve standardization:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Decouple team dependencies and drive consistent application of cost-control policies across the organization.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enable ownership:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Empower individual teams to build and manage their own detection rules for specific use cases, fostering a culture of financial accountability.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Simplify auditing:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Easily run infrastructure checks across your entire organization and consolidate the findings into a single BigQuery dataset for streamlined reporting and analysis.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By codifying your FinOps policies, you can define them once and run continuous scans to detect violations across your entire cloud environment on a regular schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Workload Manager makes this easy, providing you with out-of-the-box rules across Security, Cost, Reliability etc. Here are some examples of FinOps cost management policies that can be automated with Workload Manager:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Must have required label or tag for a specific google cloud resource (eg: BigQuery dataset)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enforce lifecycle management or autoclass configuration for every cloud storage bucket</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ensure appropriate data retention is set for storage (eg: BigQuery tables)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Disable simultaneous multi-threading to optimize licensing costs (eg: SQL Server)</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"Figure - 1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Figure_-_1.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure - 1: Default Workload Manager policies as per Google Cloud best practices</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Don't find what you need?

The tool uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego for defining custom rules. In this blog we will take a primary use case for FinOps \u2014 that is, to ensure resources are properly labeled for cost allocation and showback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You can choose from hundreds of </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/workload-manager/docs/reference/best-practices-general\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">predefined rules</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> authored by Google Cloud experts that cover FinOps, reliability, security, and operations according to the Google Cloud best practices or create and customize your own rules (checkout examples from the </span><a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/workload-manager/tree/main/rules\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Cloud GitHub repository</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">). In our example we will use one of the predefined \u2018Google Cloud Best Practices\u2019 rules for bigquery-missing-labels on a dataset. In this case, navigate to the Workload Manager section in your Google Cloud Console and start by creating a new evaluation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Give your evaluation a name and select \"Custom\" as the workload type. This is where you can point Workload Manager to the Cloud Storage bucket that contains your custom FinOps rules if you\u2019ve built one. The experience allows you to run both pre-defined and custom rule checks in one evaluation.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"Figure - 2\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Figure_-_2.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure 2 - Creating new evaluation rule</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 2: Define the scope of your scan</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Next, define the scope of your evaluation. You have the flexibility to scan your entire Google Cloud organization, specific folders, or individual projects. This allows you to apply broad cost-governance policies organization-wide, or create more targeted rules for specific teams or environments. You can also apply filters based on resource labels or names for more granular control. In this example, region selection lets you select where you want to process your data to meet data residency requirements.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"Figure - 3\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Figure_-_3.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure 3 - Selecting scope and location for your evaluation rule</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 3: Schedule and notify</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">With FinOps, automation is key. You can schedule your evaluation to run at a specific cadence, from hourly to monthly. This helps ensure continuous monitoring and provides a historical record of your policy compliance. Optionally, but highly recommended for FinOps, you can configure the evaluation to save all results to a BigQuery dataset for historical analysis and reporting.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You can also set up notifications to alert the right teams when an issue is found.

        "description": "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">When we talk about artificial intelligence (AI), we often focus on the models, the powerful TPUs and GPUs, and the massive datasets. But behind the scenes, there's an unsung hero making it all possible: </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">networking</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. While it's often abstracted away, networking is the crucial connective tissue that enables your AI workloads to function efficiently, securely, and at scale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In this post, we explore seven key ways networking interacts with your AI workloads on Google Cloud, from accessing public APIs to enabling next-generation, AI-driven network operations.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#1 - Securely accessing AI APIs</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Many of the powerful AI models available today, like Gemini on Vertex AI, are accessed via public APIs. When you make a call to an endpoint like </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">*-aiplatform.googleapis.com</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, you're dependent on a reliable network connection. To gain access these endpoints require proper authentication. This ensures that only authorized users and applications can access these powerful models, helping to safeguard your data and your AI investments. You can also access these endpoints privately, which we will see in more detail in point # 5.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#2 - Exposing models for inference</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Once you've trained or tuned your model, you need to make it </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/deployment\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">available for inference</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. In addition to managed offerings in Google Cloud, you also have the flexibility to deploy your models on infrastructure you control, using specialized </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus#gpu-models\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">VM families with powerful GPUs</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. For example, you can deploy your model on </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/kubernetes-engine-overview\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> and use the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/about-gke-inference-gateway\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">GKE Inference Gateway</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, Cloud Load Balancing, or a ClusterIP to expose it for private or public inference. These networking components act as the entry point for your applications, allowing them to interact with your model deployments seamlessly and reliably.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#3 - High-speed GPU-to-GPU communication</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AI workloads, especially training, involve moving massive amounts of data between GPUs. Traditional networking, which relies on CPU copy operations, can create bottlenecks. This is where protocols like </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Remote Direct Memory Access</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> (</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">RDMA) </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">come in. RDMA bypasses the CPU, allowing for direct memory-to-memory communication between GPUs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To support this, the underlying network must be lossless and high-performance. Google has built out a </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-network-bandwidth#h200-gpus\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">non-blocking rail-aligned network topology</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> in its data center architecture to support RDMA communication and node scaling. Several high-performance GPU VM families support </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/network-profiles#about_network_profiles\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCEv2)</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, providing the speed and efficiency needed for demanding AI workloads.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#4 - Data ingestion and storage connectivity</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Your AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on. This data needs to be stored, accessed, and retrieved efficiently. Google Cloud offers a variety of storage options, for example </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ai-ml/storage-for-ai-ml#review-storage-options\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Cloud Storage</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ai-ml/storage-for-ai-ml#review-storage-options\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Hyperdisk ML</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ai-ml/storage-for-ai-ml#review-storage-options\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Managed Lustre</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. Networking is what connects your compute resources to your data. Whether you're accessing data directly or over the network, having a high-throughput, low-latency connection to your storage is essential for keeping your AI pipeline running smoothly.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#5 - Private connectivity to AI workloads</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Security is paramount, and you often need to ensure that your AI workloads are not exposed to the public internet. Google Cloud provides several ways to achieve private communication to both managed Vertex AI services and your own DIY AI deployments. These include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">VPC Service Controls</strong></a><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Creates a service perimeter to prevent data exfiltration.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Private Service Connect</strong></a><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Allows you to access Google APIs and managed services privately from your VPC. You can use PSC endpoints to connect to your own services or Google services.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/best-practices\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cloud DNS</strong></a><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services#configure-dns-manual\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Private DNS zones</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> can be used to resolve internal IP addresses for your AI services.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#6 - Bridging the gap with hybrid cloud connections</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Many enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy, with sensitive data remaining on-premises. The Cross-Cloud Network allows you to architect your network to provide any-to-any connectivity.

        "description": "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Upgrading a Kubernetes cluster has always been a one-way street: you move forward, and if the control plane has an issue, your only option is to roll forward with a fix. This adds significant risk to routine maintenance, a problem made worse as organizations upgrade more frequently for new AI features while demanding maximum reliability. Today, in partnership with the Kubernetes community, we are introducing a new capability in Kubernetes 1.33 that solves this: Kubernetes control-plane minor-version rollback. For the first time, you have a reliable path to revert a control-plane upgrade, fundamentally changing cluster lifecycle management.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through; vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This feature is available in open-source Kubernetes, and is integrated and generally available in Google Kubernetes Engine starting in GKE 1.33 soon.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge: Why were rollbacks so hard?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Kubernetes' control plane components, especially kube-apiserver and etcd, are stateful and highly sensitive to API version changes. When you upgrade, many new APIs and features are introduced in the new binary. Some data might be migrated to new formats and API versions. Downgrading was unsupported because there was no mechanism to safely revert changes, risking data corruption and complete cluster failure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As a simple example, consider adding a new field to an existing resource. Until now, both the storage and API progressed in a single step, allowing clients to write data to that new field immediately. If a regression was detected, rolling back removed access to that field, but the data written to it would not be garbage-collected. Instead, it would persist silently in etcd. This left the administrator in an impossible situation. Worse, upon a future re-upgrade to that minor version, this stale \"garbage\" data could suddenly become \"alive\" again, introducing potentially problematic and indeterministic behavior.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The solution: Emulated versions</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP), </span><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/4330-compatibility-versions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">KEP-4330: Compatibility Versions</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, introduces the concept of an \"emulated version\" for the control plane. Contributed by Googlers, this creates a new two-step upgrade process:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 1: Upgrade binaries. </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You upgrade the control plane binary, but the \"emulated version\" stays the same as the pre-upgrade version. At this stage, all APIs, features, and storage data formats remain unchanged. This makes it safe to roll back your control plane to the previously stable version if you find a problem.</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Validate health and check for regressions.</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> The 1st step creates a safe validation window during which you can verify that it's safe to proceed \u2014 for example, making sure your own components or workloads are running healthy under the new binaries and checking for any performance regressions before committing to the new API versions.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 2:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Finalize upgrade.</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> After you complete your testing, you \"bump\" the emulated version to the new version. This enables all the new APIs and features of the latest Kubernetes release and completes the upgrade.</span></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_dq2nDBb.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This two-step process gives you granular control, more observability, and a safe window for rollbacks. If an upgrade has an unexpected issue, you no longer need to scramble to roll forward. You now have a reliable way to revert to a known-good state, stabilize your cluster, and plan your next move calmly. This is all backed by comprehensive testing for the two-step upgrade in both open-source Kubernetes and GKE.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enabling this was a major effort, and we want to thank all the Kubernetes contributors and feature owners whose collective work to test, comply, and adapt their features made this advanced capability a reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This feature, coming soon to GKE 1.33, gives you a new tool to de-risk upgrades and dramatically shorten recovery time from unforeseen complications.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A better upgrade experience in OSS Kubernetes</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This rollback capability is just one part of our broader, long-term investment in improving the Kubernetes upgrade experience for the entire community. At Google, we\u2019ve been working upstream on several other critical enhancements to make cluster operations smoother, safer, and more automated. Here are just a few examples:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Support for skip-version upgrades:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our work on KEP-4330 also makes it possible to enable \"skip-level\" upgrades for Kubernetes. This means that instead of having to upgrade sequentially through every minor version (e.g., v1.33 to v1.34 to v1.35), you will be able to upgrade directly from an older version to a newer one, potentially skipping one or more intermediate releases (e.g., v1.33 to v1.35). This aims to reduce the complexity and downtime associated with major upgrades, making the process more efficient and less disruptive for cluster operators.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Coordinated Leader Election (KEP-4355):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> This effort ensures that different control plane components (like kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler) can gracefully handle leadership changes during an upgrade, so that the Kubernetes version skew policy is not violated.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Graceful Leader Transition (KEP-5366):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Building on the above, this allows a leader to cleanly hand off its position before shutting down for an upgrade, enabling zero-downtime transitions for control plane components.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Mixed Version Proxy (KEP-4020):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> This feature improves API server reliability in mixed-version clusters (like during an upgrade). It prevents false \"NotFound\" errors by intelligently routing resource requests to a server that recognizes the resource. It also ensures discovery provides a complete list of all resources from all servers in a mixed-version cluster.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Component Health SLIs for Upgrades (KEP-3466):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> To upgrade safely, you need to know if the cluster is healthy. This KEP defines standardized Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for core Kubernetes components. This provides a clear, data-driven signal that can be used for automated upgrade canary analysis, stopping a bad rollout before it impacts the entire cluster.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Together, these features represent a major step forward in the maturity of Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management. We are incredibly proud to contribute this work to the open-source community and to bring these powerful capabilities to our GKE customers.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Learn more at KubeCon</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Want to learn more about the open-source feature and how it's changing upgrades?

They will leverage AI to enhance the speed, scope, and effectiveness of operations, streamlining and scaling attacks across the entire lifecycle.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>Prompt Injection Risks:</strong> A critical and growing threat is prompt injection, an attack that manipulates AI to bypass its security protocols and follow an attacker's hidden command.

While Ray provides the core scaling capabilities, developers have often managed the unique architectural details of each accelerator. For Cloud TPUs, this included its specific networking model and Single Programming Multiple Data (SPMD) programming style.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As part of </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/partnering-with-anyscale-to-integrate-rayturbo-with-gke?e=48754805\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">our partnership with Anyscale</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, we are working on reducing the engineering effort to get started with TPUs on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Our goal is to make the Ray experience on TPUs as native and low-friction as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Today, we are launching several key improvements that help make that possible.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ray TPU Library for improved TPU awareness and scaling in Ray Core</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">TPUs have a unique architecture and a specific programming style called SPMD. Large AI jobs run on a TPU slice, which is a collection of chips connected by high-speed networking called interchip interconnect (ICI).</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_oDu45Si.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Previously, you needed to manually configure Ray to be aware of this specific hardware topology. This was a major setup step, and if done incorrectly, jobs could get fragmented resources from different, unconnected slices, causing severe performance bottlenecks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This new library, </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">ray.util.tpu</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, abstracts away these hardware details. It uses a feature called </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">SlicePlacementGroup</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> along with the new </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">label_selector</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> API to automatically reserve the entire, co-located TPU slice as one atomic unit. This guarantees the job runs on unified hardware, preventing performance issues from fragmentation. Because Ray couldn't guarantee this single-slice atomicity before, building reliable true multi-slice training (which intentionally spans multiple unique slices) was impossible. This new API also provides the critical foundation for Ray users to use Multislice technology to scale using multiple TPU slices.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Expanded support for Jax, Ray Train and Ray Serve\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our developments cover both training and inference. For training, Ray Train now offers alpha support for JAX (via </span><a href=\"https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/distributed-training-tpu\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">JaxTrainer</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">) and PyTorch on TPUs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">JaxTrainer</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> API simplifies running JAX workloads on multi-host TPUs. It now automatically handles the complex distributed host initialization. As shown in the code example below, you only need to define your hardware needs\u2014like the number of workers, topology, and accelerator type\u2014within a simple </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">ScalingConfig</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> object. The </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">JaxTrainer</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> takes care of the rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This is a significant improvement because it solves a critical performance problem: resource fragmentation. Previously, a job requesting a \"4x4\" topology (which must run on a single co-located hardware unit called a slice) could instead receive fragmented resources\u2014for example, eight chips from one physical slice and eight chips from a different, unconnected slice. This fragmentation was a major bottleneck, as it prevented the workload from using the high-speed ICI interconnect that only exists within a single, unified slice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Example of how the JaxTrainer simplifies training on multi-host TPU:</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-code\"><dl>\n    <dt>code_block</dt>\n    <dd>&lt;ListValue: [StructValue([(&#x27;code&#x27;, &#x27;import jax\\r\\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\\r\\nimport optax\\r\\nimport ray.train\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom ray.train.v2.jax import JaxTrainer\\r\\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\\r\\n\\r\\ndef train_func():\\r\\n&quot;&quot;&quot;This function is run on each distributed worker.&quot;&quot;&quot;\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\n# Define the hardware configuration for your distributed job.\\r\\nscaling_config = ScalingConfig(\\r\\nnum_workers=4,\\r\\nuse_tpu=True,\\r\\ntopology=&quot;4x4&quot;,\\r\\naccelerator_type=&quot;TPU-V6E&quot;,\\r\\nplacement_strategy=&quot;SPREAD&quot;\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Define and run the JaxTrainer.\\r\\ntrainer = JaxTrainer(\\r\\ntrain_loop_per_worker=train_func,\\r\\nscaling_config=scaling_config,\\r\\n)\\r\\nresult = trainer.fit()\\r\\nprint(f&quot;Training finished on TPU v6e 4x4 slice&quot;)&#x27;), (&#x27;language&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;), (&#x27;caption&#x27;, &lt;wagtail.rich_text.RichText object at 0x7fe168097250&gt;)])]&gt;</dd>\n</dl></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ray Serve APIs support TPUs and with the improvements we have made to </span><a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/10/16/vllm-tpu.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">vLLM TPU</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, you can continue to use Ray on vLLM when moving to TPUs. This allows you to use the same stack you use on GPUs and run it on TPUs with minimal code changes.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Label-based Scheduling API for easy obtainability</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The new </span><a href=\"https://www.anyscale.com/blog/introducing-label-selectors-scheduling-ray\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Label-Based Scheduling API</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> integrates with </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-new-gke-custom-compute-class-api/\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">GKE</strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">custom compute classes</strong></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. A custom compute class is a simple way to define a named hardware configuration. For example, you can create a class called </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">cost-optimized</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> that tells GKE to try acquiring a Spot instance first, then fall back to a </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/dws/pricing?e=48754805&amp;hl=en\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Dynamic Workload Scheduler</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> FlexStart instance, and finally to a reserved instance as a last resort. The new Ray API lets you use classes directly from Python. With a simple </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">label_selector</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, you can request hardware like \"TPU-V6E\" or target your </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">cost-optimized</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> class, all without managing separate YAML files.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This same </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">label_selector </code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">mechanism also exposes deep hardware control for TPUs. As GKE provisions the TPU pods for a slice, it injects metadata (like worker rank and topology) into each one. KubeRay (which manages Ray on GKE) then reads this GKE-provided metadata and automatically translates it into Ray-specific labels as it creates the nodes. This provides key information like the TPU generation (ray.io/accelerator-type), the physical chip topology (ray.io/tpu-topology), and the worker rank within the slice (</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">ray.io/tpu-worker-id</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These node labels let you use a Ray label_selector to pin SPMD workloads to specific, co-located hardware, such as a \"4x4\" topology or a particular worker rank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In the example below, a Ray user can request a v6e-32 TPU slice but instruct GKE to use custom compute classes to fallback to v5e-16 if that\u2019s not available. Similarly, the user could start by requesting spot or DWS resources and if not available, fallback to reservation instances.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368;
