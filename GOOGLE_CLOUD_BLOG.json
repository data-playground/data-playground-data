The EOE made one thing clear: to succeed,</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">data had to be at the core of everything.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This realization led Ericsson to develop its first enterprise data strategy, which established the core principles for how data is collected, managed and governed. However, building a strategy is one thing \u2014 operationalizing it at scale is another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To move beyond theory to address real-world challenges, Ericsson needed to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Build trust:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Provide discoverable, clean, reliable, and well-understood data to the teams deploying analytics, AI, and automation.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Balance defense and offense:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Ensure compliance with contracts and regulations (defensive governance) while empowering teams to innovate and create value from data (offensive governance).</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ensure data integrity: </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ericsson users see data integrity as the core principle for effective data management. Data quality, which is essential for reliable, trustworthy data throughout its lifecycle, is a key quality indicator (KQI) for measuring effectiveness. Any quality deviations must be managed like a high-priority incident with clear Service Level Agreements (SLA) for restoration and resolution.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To realize this vision, Ericsson sought a platform that could match its ambition for global-scale governance and innovation \u2014 and Dataplex Universal Catalog emerged as the ideal choice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ericsson made its selection based on four key criteria.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">First, its capabilities aligned perfectly with Ericsson\u2019s requirements for cloud-native transformation, business principles, and a long-term governance vision, underpinned by Ericsson\u2019s strategic partnership with Google Cloud. Second, from a technical standpoint, Dataplex provided a tightly integrated, end-to-end ecosystem as a native Google Cloud solution, translating to faster time-to-market for use cases and reduced integration overhead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Third, the platform offered a practical operating model that enabled quick learning, adaptation, and self-sufficiency, supporting an agile approach where Ericsson could fail fast and iterate. Finally, as an existing Google Cloud customer, Dataplex presented a clear and manageable Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), serving as a natural extension of Ericsson\u2019s existing environment and providing a clear, manageable cost profile for both storage and compute extension with governance capabilities.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Putting governance into practice: Key capabilities in action</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">With Dataplex Universal Catalog as the governance foundation, Ericsson began implementing the core pillars of its governance program, moving from manual processes to an automated, intelligent data fabric.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">More specifically, Ericsson established a unified business vocabulary within Dataplex. This transformative first step eliminated ambiguity and ensured their teams \u2014 from data scientists to data analysts \u2014 were speaking the same language. These glossaries also captured tribal knowledge and became the foundation for creating trusted data products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In addition, Dataplex's catalog is at the heart of the data governance solution, making data discovery simple and intuitive for authorized users. Ericsson uses its tagging capabilities to enrich the data assets with critical metadata, including data classification, ownership, retention policies, and sensitivity labels. Dataplex\u2019s ability to automatically visualize data lineage, down to the column level, is another game-changer. Different data personas can instantly understand a dataset's origin and its downstream impact, dramatically increasing trust and reducing investigation time. </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Furthermore, trustworthy AI models are built on high-quality data. For proactive data quality, Ericsson uses Dataplex to run automated quality checks and profiles on its data pipelines. When a quality rule is breached, an alert is automatically triggered, creating an incident in its service management platform to ensure data issues are treated with the urgency they deserve.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These capabilities are all underpinned by Ericsson's</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Data Operating Model (DOM), a framework that defines the policies, people, processes, and technology needed to translate its data strategy into tangible value, comprising several facets when working with data.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_nGFHVwm.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><ol>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enterprise data architecture:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Managing data flow, enterprise data modeling and best practices for data collection till consumption</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Technology and tools</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Business glossary, master, reference and metadata management, data modeling, and data quality management</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Roles and responsibilities:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Roles to manage and govern data (i.e., end-to-end data lifecycle and stewardship)</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Data and model assurance:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Data pipelines monitoring, data observability, and data quality monitoring</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Governance: </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Manage data compliance, risk and security management, managing operational level agreement, objective and key results, and audit management</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Processes:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Data governance, data quality, data management, and data consent related processes</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Looking ahead: The future is integrated and intelligent</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As a global technology leader, Ericsson is committed to shaping the future of AI-powered data governance. Technology, especially in the AI space, is evolving at a breathtaking pace and both the data and AI governance practices must keep up.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These developments are guiding Ericsson\u2019s future priorities, which include bridging the gap between data and AI governance, especially with the rise of generative and agentic AI. These plans include evaluating using generative AI capabilities in BigQuery and Dataplex to simplify governance and pursuing solutions that ensure transparency, explainability, fairness and manage risk in the deployment of AI models.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In addition to harnessing the power of AI for at-scale governance, Ericsson will also include usage of governance workflows, glossary-driven data quality policies, at-scale assignment of terms to assets, bulk import and export of glossaries, AI-powered glossary recommendations, and data quality re-usability functionalities. Ericsson is also aligning its architecture with data fabric and data mesh principles, empowering teams with self-service access to high-quality, trusted data products.</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, Ericsson will be assessing the use of more granular, policy-based access controls to complement existing role-based access, further strengthening its data security, protection and privacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">For any organization embarking on a similar path, Ericsson\u2019s experience offers several key lessons:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Governance is a value enabler, not a blocker:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> A modern data governance program is focused on business enablement first, driving value and innovation, to complement policies, rules and risk management.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">It's a journey, not a destination:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Be prepared to fail fast, learn, and adapt. The landscape is constantly changing at breakneck speed.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Focus on business outcomes, not tools:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Technology is a critical enabler, but the conversation is about the business value you\u2019re creating. Simplify the story, speak the language of the business, and unpack the hype.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Culture is everything:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> For governance to be effective, it\u2019s the responsibility of everyone. This requires strong leadership, sponsorship, and a \"data-first\" mindset embedded throughout the organization.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By partnering with Google Cloud and tapping into the power of Dataplex Universal Catalog, Ericsson is building a data foundation that is not only compliant and secure but agile and intelligent \u2014 ready to power the next generation of autonomous networks.</span></p></div>",

While you can generate embeddings out of the box for in line search use cases, we also wanted AlloyDB to address the complexity of creating and maintaining huge numbers of vector embeddings.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To make this possible, we\u2019re introducing two new features for AlloyDB AI, available in preview, that will empower you to transform your existing operational database into a powerful, AI-native database with just a few lines of SQL:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Auto vector embeddings</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Auto vector index</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/ai/generate-manage-auto-embeddings-for-tables\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Auto vector embeddings</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> transform operational data into vector search ready data by vectorizing data stored inside of AlloyDB at scale.

The basic steps are familiar to any AI developer: generate vector embeddings using specialized AI models, import the vectors into the database alongside the underlying text, and tune vector indexes. In other words, build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, extract the data from your database, apply transformations, run it through the AI model, reload and reformat it, then reinsert it into your database and then tune the vector indexes. This approach not only involves significant engineering complexity but also introduces latency, making it difficult to keep your application in sync with your live data despite it being stored alongside it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">An additional challenge is to keep the vector index up to date, which is hard to do manually. While manually tuned indexes are performant and provide excellent results, they can be sensitive to updates in the underlying data and require performance and quality testing before they\u2019re ready to hit the road.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Let's walk through an example journey of an operational workload and see how AlloyDB AI\u2019s new features remove friction from building enterprise-grade AI, and enable users to modernize applications from their database.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AlloyDB as a vector database</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Imagine you run a large e-commerce platform with a </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">products</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> table in AlloyDB, containing structured data like </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">product_id</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">color</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">price</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, and </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">inventory_count</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, alongside unstructured data such as </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">product_description</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You want to build a gen AI search feature to improve the quality of search in your application and make it more dynamic and personalized for users.

To refine the quality, you also want to combine this semantic matching with structured filters such as </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">color = 'maroon'</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> or </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">price &lt; 100</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.

This cache, crucial for speeding up LLM inference by storing Key (K) and Value (V) matrices, directly impacts context length, concurrency, and overall system throughput. Our primary goal is to maximize the KV Cache hit ratio by intelligently expanding NVIDIA GPU High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with a tiered node-local storage solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our collaboration with the LMCache team (Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, and Yihua Cheng from Tensormesh) has led to the development of an innovative solution on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">T</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">iered Storage: Expanding the KV Cache Beyond HBM</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">LMCache extends the KV Cache from the NVIDIA GPU's fast HBM (Tier 1) to larger, more cost-effective tiers like CPU RAM and local SSDs. This dramatically increases the total cache size, leading to a higher hit ratio and improved inference performance by keeping more data locally on the accelerator node.

Partitioning your vector index significantly reduces query costs and improves search accuracy for vector searches that utilize pre-filtering on the partitioning column.By partitioning your vector index, BigQuery can apply partition pruning to both your table and your vector index when you use a filter on the partitioning column in your vector search. This means BigQuery only scans the relevant partitions, decreasing I/O costs. Additionally, pre-filtering on the partitioning column makes your vector searches less likely to miss relevant results. This feature is particularly beneficial if most of your vector searches target specific partitions using pre-filters.

This means BigQuery only scans the relevant partitions, decreasing I/O costs. Additionally, pre-filtering on the partitioning column makes your vector searches less likely to miss relevant results. This feature is particularly beneficial if most of your vector searches target specific partitions using pre-filters. You can only partition TreeAH vector indexes, and the PARTITION BY clause used for the vector index must match the one used for the original table. <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-index#partitions\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Read more</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> about the partitioned indexes in vector search.</span></span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Datastream now supports BigLake Iceberg tables in BigQuery: </strong>Customers can now easily replicate data from different supported sources (<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/configure-your-source-mysql-database\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">MySQL</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/sources-postgresql\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Postgres</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/sources-sqlserver\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">SQLserver</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/sources-oracle\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Oracle</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">,</span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/sources-salesforce\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Salesforce</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/sources-mongodb\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">MongoDB</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> ) of Datastream into </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/datastream/docs/destination-blmt\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">BigLake Managed Tables</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> for use cases spanning across open lakehouse, Enterprise grade storage for analytics, streaming and AI.

This blog details the core components of Google's AI software stack that are woven into Ironwood, demonstrating how this deep co-design unlocks performance, efficiency, and scale. We cover the JAX and PyTorch ecosystems, the XLA compiler, and the high-level frameworks that make this power accessible.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">1. The co-designed foundation</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Foundation models today have trillions of parameters that require computation at ultra-large scale. We designed the Ironwood stack from the silicon up to meet this challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The core philosophy behind the Ironwood stack is system-level co-design, treating the entire TPU pod not as a collection of discrete accelerators, but as a single, cohesive supercomputer. This architecture is built on a custom interconnect that enables massive-scale Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), allowing thousands of chips to exchange data directly at high bandwidth and low latency, bypassing the host CPU. Ironwood has a total of 1.77 PB of directly accessible HBM capacity, where each chip has eight stacks of HBM3E, with a peak HBM bandwidth of 7.4 TB/s and capacity of 192 GiB.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Unlike general-purpose parallel processors,TPUs are Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built for one purpose: accelerating large-scale AI workloads. The deep integration of compute, memory, and networking is the foundation of their performance. At a high level, the TPU consists of two parts:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Hardware core</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: The TPU core is centered around a dense</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Matrix Multiply Unit (MXU)</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> for matrix operations, complemented by a powerful </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Vector Processing Unit (VPU)</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> for element-wise operations (activations, normalizations) and </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">SparseCores</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> for scalable embedding lookups.

Since 2006, the platform has helped more than a million users globally simplify business management, track financials, and improve communication. To support this massive scale and their ambitious vision, they rely on a robust technology stack on Google Cloud, including, recently, Memorystore for Valkey. Read on to hear about their migration from Memorystore for Redis to the new platform.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Running a construction business is a complex balancing act that requires a constant stream of real-time information to keep projects on track. At </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Buildertrend, </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">we understand the challenges our customers face \u2014 from fluctuating material costs and supply chain delays to managing tight deadlines and the risk of budget overruns \u2014 and work to help construction professionals improve efficiency, reduce risk, and enhance collaboration, all while growing their bottom line.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge: Caching at scale</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The construction industry has historically been slow to adopt new technologies, hindering efficiency and scalability. At Buildertrend, we aim to change this by being at the forefront of adopting new technology. When </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-general-availability-of-memorystore-for-valkey\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Memorystore for Valkey became generally available</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, we spent time looking into whether it could help us modernize our stack and deliver value to customers. We were attracted by Valkey's truly open source posture and its promised performance benefits over competing technologies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Before adopting Memorystore for Valkey, we had used Memorystore for Redis. While it served our basic needs, we found ourselves hitting a wall when it came to a critical feature: native cross-regional replication. As we scaled, we needed a solution that could support a global user base and provide seamless failover in case of a disaster or other issues within a region. We also needed a modern connectivity model such as Google Cloud\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Private Service Connect</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to enhance network security and efficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As a fully managed, scalable, and highly available in-memory data store, Memorystore for Valkey offered the key features we needed out of the box to take our platform to the next level.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A modern solution for a modern problem</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Within this ecosystem, we use Memorystore for Valkey for a variety of critical functions, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Database-backed cache:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Speeds up data retrieval for a faster user experience</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Session state:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Manages user sessions for web applications</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Job storage:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Handles asynchronous task queues for background processes</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Pub/Sub idempotency keys:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Ensures messages are processed exactly once, preventing data duplication</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Authentication tokens</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Securely validates user identity with cryptographically signed tokens, enabling fast, scalable authentication</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By leveraging the cache in these scenarios, our application is fast, resilient, and ready to meet the demands of our growing customer base. The native cross regional replication helped us support a global user base without having to worry about keeping global caches in sync.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A seamless migration with minimal disruption</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Migrating from Memorystore for Redis to Memorystore for Valkey was a smooth process, thanks to close collaboration with the Google Cloud team. We worked with the Google Cloud team to identify the best approach, which for us involved exporting data to Google Cloud Storage and seeding the data at Valkey instance creation, allowing us to migrate with minimal downtime. Because Memorystore for Valkey natively supports Private Service Connect, we were able to eliminate a proxy layer that our engineers used to connect to our Memorystore for Redis instances, simplifying our stack and improving our networking posture.</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Looking ahead to a global future</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Although it's still early in our journey, the impact is already clear. Memorystore for Valkey has unlocked our ability to scale and drastically reduced our time to market. It has allowed our team to streamline and own deployment processes, so they can be more agile and responsive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">For us, the future is about global scalability.

Since 2006, the platform has helped more than a million users globally simplify business management, track financials, and improve communication. To support this massive scale and their ambitious vision, they rely on a robust technology stack on Google Cloud, including, recently, Memorystore for Valkey. Read on to hear about their migration from Memorystore for Redis to the new platform.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Running a construction business is a complex balancing act that requires a constant stream of real-time information to keep projects on track. At </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Buildertrend, </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">we understand the challenges our customers face \u2014 from fluctuating material costs and supply chain delays to managing tight deadlines and the risk of budget overruns \u2014 and work to help construction professionals improve efficiency, reduce risk, and enhance collaboration, all while growing their bottom line.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge: Caching at scale</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The construction industry has historically been slow to adopt new technologies, hindering efficiency and scalability. At Buildertrend, we aim to change this by being at the forefront of adopting new technology. When </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-general-availability-of-memorystore-for-valkey\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Memorystore for Valkey became generally available</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, we spent time looking into whether it could help us modernize our stack and deliver value to customers. We were attracted by Valkey's truly open source posture and its promised performance benefits over competing technologies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Before adopting Memorystore for Valkey, we had used Memorystore for Redis. While it served our basic needs, we found ourselves hitting a wall when it came to a critical feature: native cross-regional replication. As we scaled, we needed a solution that could support a global user base and provide seamless failover in case of a disaster or other issues within a region. We also needed a modern connectivity model such as Google Cloud\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Private Service Connect</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> to enhance network security and efficiency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As a fully managed, scalable, and highly available in-memory data store, Memorystore for Valkey offered the key features we needed out of the box to take our platform to the next level.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A modern solution for a modern problem</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Within this ecosystem, we use Memorystore for Valkey for a variety of critical functions, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Database-backed cache:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Speeds up data retrieval for a faster user experience</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Session state:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Manages user sessions for web applications</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Job storage:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Handles asynchronous task queues for background processes</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Pub/Sub idempotency keys:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Ensures messages are processed exactly once, preventing data duplication</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Authentication tokens</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Securely validates user identity with cryptographically signed tokens, enabling fast, scalable authentication</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By leveraging the cache in these scenarios, our application is fast, resilient, and ready to meet the demands of our growing customer base. The native cross regional replication helped us support a global user base without having to worry about keeping global caches in sync.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A seamless migration with minimal disruption</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Migrating from Memorystore for Redis to Memorystore for Valkey was a smooth process, thanks to close collaboration with the Google Cloud team. We worked with the Google Cloud team to identify the best approach, which for us involved exporting data to Google Cloud Storage and seeding the data at Valkey instance creation, allowing us to migrate with minimal downtime. Because Memorystore for Valkey natively supports Private Service Connect, we were able to eliminate a proxy layer that our engineers used to connect to our Memorystore for Redis instances, simplifying our stack and improving our networking posture.</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\u00a0</strong></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Looking ahead to a global future</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Although it's still early in our journey, the impact is already clear. Memorystore for Valkey has unlocked our ability to scale and drastically reduced our time to market. It has allowed our team to streamline and own deployment processes, so they can be more agile and responsive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">For us, the future is about global scalability. With nearly 300 Memorystore for Valkey instances in our fleet, we're building a globally available, cloud-native stack. Our most critical instances are highly optimized to serve up to 30,000 requests per second each, demonstrating the foundation's scalability and performance.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We strive to use scalable cloud-native technologies, and Memorystore for Valkey will enable us to continue down this path. By using the Memorystore for Valkey managed service, we not only solve technical problems, but also accelerate business growth and empower engineering teams to focus on what matters most: </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">building great products</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ready to build with Memorystore for Valkey?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Like Buildertrend, you can leverage the power of a fully managed, scalable, and highly available in-memory data store to accelerate your applications and empower your development teams.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">To get started, explore the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/valkey\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Memorystore for Valkey documentation</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\"> and sign up for a Google Cloud account!</span></p></div>",

But with its vast potential comes a shared responsibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AI can be a powerful ally for transforming businesses and reducing cost. It can help organizations minimize carbon emissions, industries manage energy use, and scientists model complex climate systems in real time. Yet the way we design, deploy, and run AI also matters. Building software sustainably means making every stage of the digital journey \u2013 from architecture to inference \u2013 more efficient, transparent, and resilient.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Innovation that serves sustainability</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">At Google, we believe innovation and sustainability go hand in hand. The same intelligence that powers breakthroughs can also help us use resources more wisely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Projects like </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Green Light</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, which uses AI to optimise traffic signals and reduce emissions, and </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Project Contrails</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, which helps airlines cut the warming effects of condensation trails, show what happens when technology serves both performance and planet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Each example reveals a helpful truth \u2013 that sustainability doesn\u2019t slow innovation but instead fuels it, enabling efficiency to become an engine of progress.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">From footprint to framework</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Every software system, including AI, has an environmental footprint \u2013 from the hardware and energy that powers data centers to the water used to cool them. Water is one of the planet\u2019s most precious and increasingly scarce resources and protecting it must be part of any technology strategy. That\u2019s why Google is investing in advanced cooling systems and </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">water stewardship projects</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> with the goal to replenish more than we consume, helping preserve local ecosystems and community supplies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Understanding this footprint helps engineers and organisations make smarter choices, like selecting efficient accelerators, rightsizing workloads, and scheduling operations when the grid is cleanest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Across Google Cloud, we\u2019re continually improving efficiency. Our Ironwood Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are nearly 30 times more energy-efficient than our first Cloud TPU from 2018, and our data centres operate at a fleet-wide Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.09, which is amongst the best in the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By designing systems that consume less energy and run on more carbon-free power, we help close the gap between </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">ambition and action</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> \u2013 turning digital progress into tangible emissions reductions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">But this isn\u2019t achieved through infrastructure alone.

That\u2019s why we encourage teams to think </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">Sustainable by Design</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, bringing efficiency, measurement, and responsibility into every stage of building software.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Sustainable by Design: a mindset for the AI era</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Today\u2019s sustainability questions aren't coming just from sustainability teams; they are coming directly from executives, financial operations teams, technology leads and developers.

It\u2019s built around a set of principles known as the </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">4Ms</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> which lay out powerful ways to embed efficiency into software:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Machine </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">- choose efficient computing resources that deliver more performance per watt.</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Model </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">- use or adapt existing models rather than starting from scratch \u2014 smaller, fine-tuned models can be faster and more resource efficient.</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Mechanisation </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">- automate data and AI operations through serverless and managed services to minimise idle compute.</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Map </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">- run workloads where and when the energy supply is cleanest.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The 4Ms help turn sustainability into a design principle, and a shared responsibility across every role in tech.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A collective journey toward resilience</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As we host the AI Days in the Nordics, the conversation about AI\u2019s environmental impact is accelerating, and so is the opportunity to act.

PROMPTFLUX is written in VBScript and interacts with Gemini's API to request specific VBScript obfuscation and evasion techniques to facilitate \"just-in-time\" self-modification, likely to evade static signature-based detection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Further examination of PROMPTFLUX samples suggests this code family is currently in a development or testing phase since some incomplete features are commented out and a mechanism exists to limit the malware's Gemini API calls. The current state of this malware does not demonstrate an ability to compromise a victim network or device. We have taken action to disable the assets</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">associated with this activity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The most novel component of PROMPTFLUX is its \"Thinking Robot\" module, designed to periodically query Gemini to obtain new code for evading antivirus software. This is accomplished using a hard-coded API key to send a POST request to the Gemini API endpoint. The actor specifies the use of the \"</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">gemini-1.5-flash-latest</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\" model; the \"</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">-latest</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\" tag ensures the malware always calls the most current stable release, making the tool more resilient to model deprecation. The prompt sent to the LLM is highly specific and machine-parsable, requesting VBScript code for antivirus evasion and instructing the LLM to output only the code itself.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Although the self-modification function (</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AttemptToUpdateSelf</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">) is commented out, its presence, combined with the active logging of AI responses to \"</span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">%TEMP%\\thinking_robot_log.txt</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\", clearly indicates the author's goal of creating a metamorphic script that can evolve over time.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"VBS &quot;StartThinkingRobot&quot; function\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/misuse-of-ai-two-fig1.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure 1: VBS \"StartThinkingRobot\" function</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">We identified multiple variations of PROMPTFLUX using LLM-driven code regeneration, including one with the \"Thinking Robot\" function replaced with a new \"Thinging\" function. This function leverages a prompt to instruct the Gemini API to rewrite the malware's entire source code on an hourly basis to evade detection. The prompt directs the LLM to act as an \"expert VBScript obfuscator,\" ensuring the new variant remains viable by embedding the original decoy payload, the hard-coded API key, and the complete self-regeneration logic, thereby establishing a recursive cycle of mutation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Although unattributed to a specific threat actor, the filenames associated with PROMPTFLUX highlight behaviors commonly associated with financially motivated actors.

We have disabled the threat actors\u2019 accounts.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\"><table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9641%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.1839%;\"><strong>Mitigations</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.1839%;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These activities are similar to our findings from January that detailed how bad actors are leveraging Gemini for productivity vs. novel capabilities.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has observed threat actors moving beyond using AI solely for productivity gains: They\u2019re experimenting with <b>deploying novel AI-enabled malware in active operations</b>.</p><p>This shift marks a new phase in how threat actors use AI, shifting from experimentation to wider takeup of tools. It follows our analysis on the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/adversarial-misuse-generative-ai\">adversarial misuse of generative AI</a>, where we found that, up until the point when we published the report in January, threat actors were using Gemini mostly for productivity gains.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6\n      h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n      <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n        <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">At Google, we are committed to developing AI responsibly and are taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity, disabling the projects and accounts associated with these threat actors.</q>\n\n        \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p>Based on GTIG\u2019s unique visibility into the misuse of AI tools and the broader threat landscape, the new report details four key findings on how government-backed threat actors and cybercriminals are integrating AI across their entire attack lifecycle. By understanding how adversaries are innovating with AI, security leaders can get ahead of threats and take proactive measures to update their security posture against a changing threat landscape.</p><p><b>1. AI generating commands to steal documents and data</b></p><p>For the first time, GTIG has identified malware families that use large language models (LLMs) during execution. These tools can dynamically generate malicious scripts, use self-modification to obfuscate their own code to evade detection, and receive commands from AI models rather than traditional command-and-control (C2) servers.</p><p>One such new malware detailed in the full report is a data miner we track as PROMPTSTEAL. In June, GTIG identified the Russian government-backed actor APT28 (also known as FROZENLAKE) using PROMPTSTEAL, which masquerades as an image generation program that guides the user through a series of prompts to generate images.</p><p>In the background, PROMPSTEAL queries the API for Hugging Face, a platform for open-source machine learning including LLMs, to generate commands for execution, rather than hard-coding commands in the malware. The prompt specifically asks the LLM to output commands to gather system information, to copy documents to a specified directory, and to exfiltrate data.</p><p>Our analysis indicates continued development of this malware, with new samples adding obfuscation and changing the C2 method.</p><p>FROZENLAKE\u2019s use of PROMPTSTEAL constitutes <b>our first observation of malware querying a LLM deployed in live operations</b>. Combined with other recent experimental implementations of novel AI techniques, this campaign provides an early indicator of how threats are evolving and how adversaries can potentially integrate AI capabilities into future intrusion activity.</p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with their activity. Google DeepMind has also used these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse by strengthening both Google\u2019s classifiers and the model itself. This enables the model to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>2. Social engineering to bypass safeguards</b></p><p>Threat actors have been adopting social engineering pretexts in their prompts to bypass AI safeguards. We observed actors posing as cybersecurity researchers and as students in capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions to persuade Gemini to provide information that would otherwise receive a safety response from Gemini.</p><p>In one interaction, a threat actor asked Gemini to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system, but received a safety response from Gemini that a detailed response would not be safe. They reframed the prompt by depicting themselves as a participant in a CTF exercise, and in response Gemini returned helpful information that could be misused to exploit the system.</p><p>The threat actor appeared to learn from this interaction and continued to use the CTF pretext over several weeks in support of phishing, exploitation, and webshell development.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: We took action against the CTF threat actor by disabling the assets associated with the actor\u2019s activity. Google DeepMind was able to use these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>3. Maturing cybercrime marketplace for AI tooling</b></p><p>In addition to misusing mainstream AI-enabled tools and services, there is a growing interest and marketplace for purpose-built AI tools and services that can enable illicit activities. To identify evolving threats, GTIG tracks posts and advertisements on underground forums related to AI tools and services as well as discussions surrounding the technology.</p><p>Many underground forum advertisements mirror language comparable to marketing for legitimate AI models, citing the need to improve the efficiency of workflows and effort while simultaneously offering guidance for prospective customers interested in their offerings.</p><p>The underground marketplace for illicit AI tools has matured in 2025. GTIG has <a href=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1762840/episodes/17689432-ai-tools-and-sentiment-within-the-underground-cyber-crime-community\" target=\"_blank\">identified multiple offerings</a> of multifunctional tools designed to support phishing, malware development, vulnerability research, and other capabilities. This development has lowered the barrier to entry for less sophisticated, poorly-resourced threat actors.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: While there are no direct mitigations to prevent threat actors from developing their own AI tools, at Google we <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-google-does-it-threat-intelligence-uncover-track-cybercrime?e=48754805\">use threat intelligence to disrupt adversary operations</a> \u2014 including monitoring the cybercrime AI tool marketplace.</p><p><b>4. Continued augmentation of the full attack lifecycle</b></p><p>State-sponsored actors from North Korea, Iran, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) continue to misuse AI to enhance all stages of their operations, from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to C2 development and data exfiltration.</p><p>In one example, GTIG observed a suspected PRC-nexus actor using Gemini to support multiple stages of an intrusion campaign, including conducting initial reconnaissance on targets, researching phishing techniques to deliver payloads, soliciting assistance from Gemini related to lateral movement, seeking technical support for C2 efforts once inside a victim\u2019s system, and helping with data exfiltration.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: GTIG takes a holistic, intelligence-driven approach to detecting and disrupting threat activity. Our understanding of government-backed threat actors and their campaigns can help provide the needed context to identify threat-enabling activity. By tracking this activity, we\u2019re able to leverage our insights to counter threats across Google platforms, including disrupting the activity of threat actors who have misused Gemini.</p><p>Our learnings from countering malicious activities are fed back into our product development to improve safety and security for our AI models. Google DeepMind was able to use these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>Building AI safely and responsibly</b></p><p>At Google, we are committed to developing AI responsibly and are taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity, disabling the projects and accounts associated with these threat actors. In addition to taking action against accounts, we have proactively fed the intelligence back into our teams and products to better protect Google and its users.

This marks a new operational phase of AI abuse, involving tools that dynamically alter behavior mid-execution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This report serves as an update to our January 2025 analysis, \"</span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/adversarial-misuse-generative-ai\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Adversarial Misuse of Generative AI</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">,\" and details how government-backed threat actors and cyber criminals are integrating and experimenting with AI across the industry throughout the entire attack lifecycle. Our findings are based on the broader threat landscape.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">At Google, we are committed to developing AI responsibly and take proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity by disabling the projects and accounts associated with bad actors, while continuously improving our models to make them less susceptible to misuse. We also proactively share industry best practices to arm defenders and enable stronger protections across the ecosystem. Throughout this report we\u2019ve noted steps we\u2019ve taken to thwart malicious activity, including disabling assets and applying intel to strengthen both our classifiers and model so it\u2019s protected from misuse moving forward.

These tools dynamically generate malicious scripts, obfuscate their own code to evade detection, and leverage AI models to create malicious functions on demand, rather than hard-coding them into the malware. While still nascent, this represents a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptive malware.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\"Social Engineering\" to Bypass Safeguards:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Threat actors are adopting social engineering-like pretexts in their prompts to bypass AI safety guardrails. We observed actors posing as students in a \"capture-the-flag\" competition or as cybersecurity researchers to persuade Gemini to provide information that would otherwise be blocked, enabling tool development.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Maturing Cyber Crime Marketplace for AI Tooling:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> The underground marketplace for illicit AI tools has matured in 2025. We have identified multiple offerings of multifunctional tools designed to support phishing, malware development, and vulnerability research, lowering the barrier to entry for less sophisticated actors.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Continued Augmentation of the Full Attack Lifecycle:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> State-sponsored actors including from North Korea, Iran, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) continue to misuse Gemini to enhance all stages of their operations, from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to command and control (C2) development and data exfiltration.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Threat Actors Developing Novel AI Capabilities\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">For the first time in 2025, GTIG discovered a code family that employed AI capabilities mid-execution to dynamically alter the malware\u2019s behavior. Although some recent implementations of novel AI techniques are experimental, they provide an early indicator of how threats are evolving and how they can potentially integrate AI capabilities into future intrusion activity. Attackers are moving beyond \"vibe coding\" and the baseline observed in 2024 of using AI tools for technical support. We are only now starting to see this type of activity, but expect it to increase in the future.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><div align=\"left\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\"><table><colgroup><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Malware</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Function</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Description</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Status</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f8f5e0440c57c7deffd75ca33e2511867039796aa803e7ef847396a379188a7d\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">FRUITSHELL</span></a></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Reverse Shell</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000; padding: 16px;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Publicly available reverse shell written in PowerShell that establishes a remote connection to a configured command-and-control server and allows a threat actor to execute arbitrary commands on a compromised system.

PROMPTFLUX is written in VBScript and interacts with Gemini's API to request specific VBScript obfuscation and evasion techniques to facilitate \"just-in-time\" self-modification, likely to evade static signature-based detection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Further examination of PROMPTFLUX samples suggests this code family is currently in a development or testing phase since some incomplete features are commented out and a mechanism exists to limit the malware's Gemini API calls. The current state of this malware does not demonstrate an ability to compromise a victim network or device. We have taken action to disable the assets</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">associated with this activity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The most novel component of PROMPTFLUX is its \"Thinking Robot\" module, designed to periodically query Gemini to obtain new code for evading antivirus software.

We have disabled the threat actors\u2019 accounts.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\"><table border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.9641%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.1839%;\"><strong>Mitigations</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 98.1839%;\"><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These activities are similar to our findings from January that detailed how bad actors are leveraging Gemini for productivity vs. novel capabilities.

Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has observed threat actors moving beyond using AI solely for productivity gains: They\u2019re experimenting with <b>deploying novel AI-enabled malware in active operations</b>.</p><p>This shift marks a new phase in how threat actors use AI, shifting from experimentation to wider takeup of tools. It follows our analysis on the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/adversarial-misuse-generative-ai\">adversarial misuse of generative AI</a>, where we found that, up until the point when we published the report in January, threat actors were using Gemini mostly for productivity gains.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-pull_quote\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\">\n  <section class=\"h-c-grid\">\n    <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6\n      h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\">\n      <div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\">\n        <q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">At Google, we are committed to developing AI responsibly and are taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity, disabling the projects and accounts associated with these threat actors.</q>\n\n        \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p>Based on GTIG\u2019s unique visibility into the misuse of AI tools and the broader threat landscape, the new report details four key findings on how government-backed threat actors and cybercriminals are integrating AI across their entire attack lifecycle. By understanding how adversaries are innovating with AI, security leaders can get ahead of threats and take proactive measures to update their security posture against a changing threat landscape.</p><p><b>1. AI generating commands to steal documents and data</b></p><p>For the first time, GTIG has identified malware families that use large language models (LLMs) during execution. These tools can dynamically generate malicious scripts, use self-modification to obfuscate their own code to evade detection, and receive commands from AI models rather than traditional command-and-control (C2) servers.</p><p>One such new malware detailed in the full report is a data miner we track as PROMPTSTEAL. In June, GTIG identified the Russian government-backed actor APT28 (also known as FROZENLAKE) using PROMPTSTEAL, which masquerades as an image generation program that guides the user through a series of prompts to generate images.</p><p>In the background, PROMPSTEAL queries the API for Hugging Face, a platform for open-source machine learning including LLMs, to generate commands for execution, rather than hard-coding commands in the malware. The prompt specifically asks the LLM to output commands to gather system information, to copy documents to a specified directory, and to exfiltrate data.</p><p>Our analysis indicates continued development of this malware, with new samples adding obfuscation and changing the C2 method.</p><p>FROZENLAKE\u2019s use of PROMPTSTEAL constitutes <b>our first observation of malware querying a LLM deployed in live operations</b>. Combined with other recent experimental implementations of novel AI techniques, this campaign provides an early indicator of how threats are evolving and how adversaries can potentially integrate AI capabilities into future intrusion activity.</p></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\"><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with their activity. Google DeepMind has also used these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse by strengthening both Google\u2019s classifiers and the model itself. This enables the model to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>2. Social engineering to bypass safeguards</b></p><p>Threat actors have been adopting social engineering pretexts in their prompts to bypass AI safeguards. We observed actors posing as cybersecurity researchers and as students in capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions to persuade Gemini to provide information that would otherwise receive a safety response from Gemini.</p><p>In one interaction, a threat actor asked Gemini to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system, but received a safety response from Gemini that a detailed response would not be safe. They reframed the prompt by depicting themselves as a participant in a CTF exercise, and in response Gemini returned helpful information that could be misused to exploit the system.</p><p>The threat actor appeared to learn from this interaction and continued to use the CTF pretext over several weeks in support of phishing, exploitation, and webshell development.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: We took action against the CTF threat actor by disabling the assets associated with the actor\u2019s activity. Google DeepMind was able to use these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>3. Maturing cybercrime marketplace for AI tooling</b></p><p>In addition to misusing mainstream AI-enabled tools and services, there is a growing interest and marketplace for purpose-built AI tools and services that can enable illicit activities. To identify evolving threats, GTIG tracks posts and advertisements on underground forums related to AI tools and services as well as discussions surrounding the technology.</p><p>Many underground forum advertisements mirror language comparable to marketing for legitimate AI models, citing the need to improve the efficiency of workflows and effort while simultaneously offering guidance for prospective customers interested in their offerings.</p><p>The underground marketplace for illicit AI tools has matured in 2025. GTIG has <a href=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1762840/episodes/17689432-ai-tools-and-sentiment-within-the-underground-cyber-crime-community\" target=\"_blank\">identified multiple offerings</a> of multifunctional tools designed to support phishing, malware development, vulnerability research, and other capabilities. This development has lowered the barrier to entry for less sophisticated, poorly-resourced threat actors.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: While there are no direct mitigations to prevent threat actors from developing their own AI tools, at Google we <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/transform/how-google-does-it-threat-intelligence-uncover-track-cybercrime?e=48754805\">use threat intelligence to disrupt adversary operations</a> \u2014 including monitoring the cybercrime AI tool marketplace.</p><p><b>4. Continued augmentation of the full attack lifecycle</b></p><p>State-sponsored actors from North Korea, Iran, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) continue to misuse AI to enhance all stages of their operations, from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to C2 development and data exfiltration.</p><p>In one example, GTIG observed a suspected PRC-nexus actor using Gemini to support multiple stages of an intrusion campaign, including conducting initial reconnaissance on targets, researching phishing techniques to deliver payloads, soliciting assistance from Gemini related to lateral movement, seeking technical support for C2 efforts once inside a victim\u2019s system, and helping with data exfiltration.</p><p><b>What Google is doing</b>: GTIG takes a holistic, intelligence-driven approach to detecting and disrupting threat activity. Our understanding of government-backed threat actors and their campaigns can help provide the needed context to identify threat-enabling activity. By tracking this activity, we\u2019re able to leverage our insights to counter threats across Google platforms, including disrupting the activity of threat actors who have misused Gemini.</p><p>Our learnings from countering malicious activities are fed back into our product development to improve safety and security for our AI models. Google DeepMind was able to use these insights to further strengthen our protections against misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.</p><p><b>Building AI safely and responsibly</b></p><p>At Google, we are committed to developing AI responsibly and are taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity, disabling the projects and accounts associated with these threat actors. In addition to taking action against accounts, we have proactively fed the intelligence back into our teams and products to better protect Google and its users.

To truly grasp this, let's break it down into three key ideas:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Decentralized Control</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: There\u2019s no single \u201cboss\u201d agent controlling everything. Each agent makes its own decisions based on its own rules and local information. Think of a flock of birds swirling in the sky, there's no leader, but together they form incredible, coordinated patterns.</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Local Views</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: Each agent only has a partial view of the system. It perceives and reacts to its immediate environment, not the entire system state. Imagine standing in a crowded stadium; you only see and react to the people directly around you, not the entire crowd simultaneously.</span></li>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Emergent Behavior</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: This is where the magic happens. From these simple, local interactions, complex and intelligent global behaviors emerge. Agents working together in this way can solve tasks that no single agent could easily accomplish alone.</span></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"8\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/8_bSozdwl.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This collaborative approach allows for robust, scalable, and flexible solutions to complex problems.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">How ADK Supports Multi-Agent Systems</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google\u2019s Agent Development Kit (ADK)</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> was built from the ground up with multi-agent systems in mind.

Its </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">sub-agents</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> might be VPs, who in turn manage directors, managers, and individual contributors. Everyone has a defined role, and together they accomplish the company's mission. See example <a href=\"https://github.com/cuppibla/adk_tutorial/blob/main/d_routing_agent/agents.py\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This hierarchical structure is fundamental to organizing and scaling your multi-agent system.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Orchestrating Tasks with Workflow Agents</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">So, we have a hierarchy. But how do we control the </span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline;\">flow</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> of work within that structure? This is where Workflow Agents shine. ADK provides three pre-built orchestrators to manage sub-agents:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/sequential-agents/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">SequentialAgent</strong></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">: This agent functions like an assembly line.

Do you spend more time tracking down un-tagged resources and chasing development teams than you do on strategic financial planning? In the fast-paced world of cloud, manual cost management is a losing game. It\u2019s time-consuming, prone to errors, and often, by the time you\u2019ve identified a cost anomaly, it's too late to prevent the impact.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">What if you could codify your financial governance policies and automate their enforcement across your entire Google Cloud organization? Enter Workload Manager (WLM), a powerful tool that lets you automate the validation of your cloud workloads against best practices for security and compliance, including your own custom-defined FinOps rules. Better yet, we recently slashed the cost of using Workload Manager by up to 95% for certain scenarios, letting you run large-scale scans more economically, including a small free tier to help you run small-scale tests. In this blog, we show you how to get started with automated financial governance policies in Workload Manager, so you can stop playing catch-up and start proactively managing your cloud spend.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge with manual FinOps</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Managing business-critical workloads in the cloud is complex. Staying on top of cost-control best practices is a significant and time-consuming effort. Manual reviews and audits can take weeks or even months to complete, by which time costs can spiral. This manual approach often leads to \"configuration drift,\" where systems deviate from your established cost management policies, making it difficult to detect and control spending.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Workload Manager helps you break free from these manual constraints by providing a framework for automated, continuous validation, helping FinOps teams to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Improve standardization:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Decouple team dependencies and drive consistent application of cost-control policies across the organization.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enable ownership:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Empower individual teams to build and manage their own detection rules for specific use cases, fostering a culture of financial accountability.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Simplify auditing:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Easily run infrastructure checks across your entire organization and consolidate the findings into a single BigQuery dataset for streamlined reporting and analysis.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">By codifying your FinOps policies, you can define them once and run continuous scans to detect violations across your entire cloud environment on a regular schedule.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Workload Manager makes this easy, providing you with out-of-the-box rules across Security, Cost, Reliability etc. Here are some examples of FinOps cost management policies that can be automated with Workload Manager:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Must have required label or tag for a specific google cloud resource (eg: BigQuery dataset)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enforce lifecycle management or autoclass configuration for every cloud storage bucket</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ensure appropriate data retention is set for storage (eg: BigQuery tables)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Disable simultaneous multi-threading to optimize licensing costs (eg: SQL Server)</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"Figure - 1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Figure_-_1.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure - 1: Default Workload Manager policies as per Google Cloud best practices</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Don't find what you need?

The tool uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego for defining custom rules. In this blog we will take a primary use case for FinOps \u2014 that is, to ensure resources are properly labeled for cost allocation and showback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You can choose from hundreds of </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/workload-manager/docs/reference/best-practices-general\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">predefined rules</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> authored by Google Cloud experts that cover FinOps, reliability, security, and operations according to the Google Cloud best practices or create and customize your own rules (checkout examples from the </span><a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/workload-manager/tree/main/rules\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Cloud GitHub repository</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">). In our example we will use one of the predefined \u2018Google Cloud Best Practices\u2019 rules for bigquery-missing-labels on a dataset. In this case, navigate to the Workload Manager section in your Google Cloud Console and start by creating a new evaluation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Give your evaluation a name and select \"Custom\" as the workload type. This is where you can point Workload Manager to the Cloud Storage bucket that contains your custom FinOps rules if you\u2019ve built one. The experience allows you to run both pre-defined and custom rule checks in one evaluation.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"Figure - 2\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Figure_-_2.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure 2 - Creating new evaluation rule</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 2: Define the scope of your scan</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Next, define the scope of your evaluation. You have the flexibility to scan your entire Google Cloud organization, specific folders, or individual projects. This allows you to apply broad cost-governance policies organization-wide, or create more targeted rules for specific teams or environments. You can also apply filters based on resource labels or names for more granular control. In this example, region selection lets you select where you want to process your data to meet data residency requirements.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"Figure - 3\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Figure_-_3.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n        <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><p>Figure 3 - Selecting scope and location for your evaluation rule</p></figcaption>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 3: Schedule and notify</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">With FinOps, automation is key.

        "description": "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">When we talk about artificial intelligence (AI), we often focus on the models, the powerful TPUs and GPUs, and the massive datasets. But behind the scenes, there's an unsung hero making it all possible: </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">networking</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. While it's often abstracted away, networking is the crucial connective tissue that enables your AI workloads to function efficiently, securely, and at scale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In this post, we explore seven key ways networking interacts with your AI workloads on Google Cloud, from accessing public APIs to enabling next-generation, AI-driven network operations.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#1 - Securely accessing AI APIs</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Many of the powerful AI models available today, like Gemini on Vertex AI, are accessed via public APIs. When you make a call to an endpoint like </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">*-aiplatform.googleapis.com</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, you're dependent on a reliable network connection. To gain access these endpoints require proper authentication. This ensures that only authorized users and applications can access these powerful models, helping to safeguard your data and your AI investments. You can also access these endpoints privately, which we will see in more detail in point # 5.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#2 - Exposing models for inference</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Once you've trained or tuned your model, you need to make it </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/deployment\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">available for inference</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. In addition to managed offerings in Google Cloud, you also have the flexibility to deploy your models on infrastructure you control, using specialized </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus#gpu-models\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">VM families with powerful GPUs</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. For example, you can deploy your model on </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/kubernetes-engine-overview\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> and use the </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/about-gke-inference-gateway\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">GKE Inference Gateway</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, Cloud Load Balancing, or a ClusterIP to expose it for private or public inference. These networking components act as the entry point for your applications, allowing them to interact with your model deployments seamlessly and reliably.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#3 - High-speed GPU-to-GPU communication</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AI workloads, especially training, involve moving massive amounts of data between GPUs. Traditional networking, which relies on CPU copy operations, can create bottlenecks. This is where protocols like </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Remote Direct Memory Access</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> (</span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">RDMA) </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">come in. RDMA bypasses the CPU, allowing for direct memory-to-memory communication between GPUs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To support this, the underlying network must be lossless and high-performance. Google has built out a </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/gpu-network-bandwidth#h200-gpus\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">non-blocking rail-aligned network topology</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> in its data center architecture to support RDMA communication and node scaling. Several high-performance GPU VM families support </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/network-profiles#about_network_profiles\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCEv2)</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, providing the speed and efficiency needed for demanding AI workloads.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#4 - Data ingestion and storage connectivity</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Your AI models are only as good as the data they're trained on. This data needs to be stored, accessed, and retrieved efficiently. Google Cloud offers a variety of storage options, for example </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ai-ml/storage-for-ai-ml#review-storage-options\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Google Cloud Storage</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ai-ml/storage-for-ai-ml#review-storage-options\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Hyperdisk ML</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ai-ml/storage-for-ai-ml#review-storage-options\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Managed Lustre</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">. Networking is what connects your compute resources to your data. Whether you're accessing data directly or over the network, having a high-throughput, low-latency connection to your storage is essential for keeping your AI pipeline running smoothly.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#5 - Private connectivity to AI workloads</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Security is paramount, and you often need to ensure that your AI workloads are not exposed to the public internet. Google Cloud provides several ways to achieve private communication to both managed Vertex AI services and your own DIY AI deployments. These include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">VPC Service Controls</strong></a><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Creates a service perimeter to prevent data exfiltration.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Private Service Connect</strong></a><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Allows you to access Google APIs and managed services privately from your VPC. You can use PSC endpoints to connect to your own services or Google services.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/best-practices\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cloud DNS</strong></a><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services#configure-dns-manual\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Private DNS zones</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> can be used to resolve internal IP addresses for your AI services.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#6 - Bridging the gap with hybrid cloud connections</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Many enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy, with sensitive data remaining on-premises. The Cross-Cloud Network allows you to architect your network to provide any-to-any connectivity. With design cases covering </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/architecture/ccn-distributed-apps-design\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">distributed applications</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, </span><a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/global_front_end_solution_deep_dive.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Global front end</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/cloud_wan_solution_overview.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Cloud WAN</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, you can build your architecture securely from on-premises, other clouds or other VPCs to connect to your AI workloads. This hybrid connectivity allows you to leverage the scalability of Google Cloud's AI services while keeping your data secured.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">#7 - The Future: AI-driven network operations</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The relationship between AI and networking is becoming a two-way street. With </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/overview\"><strong style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Gemini for Google Cloud</strong></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, network engineers can now use natural language to design, optimize, and troubleshoot their network architectures. This is the first step towards what we call \"agentic networking,\" where autonomous AI agents can proactively detect, diagnose, and even mitigate network issues. This transforms network engineering from a reactive discipline to a predictive and proactive one, ensuring your network is always optimized for your AI workloads.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-video\">\n\n\n\n<div class=\"article-module article-video \">\n  <figure>\n    <a class=\"h-c-video h-c-video--marquee\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=mNjysmJNmlw\">\n\n      \n        \n\n        <div class=\"article-video__aspect-image\">\n          <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Google&#x27;s global network demo: fast incident response with autonomous network operations</span>\n        </div>\n      \n      <svg class=\"h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n        <use xlink:href=\"#mi-youtube-icon\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"></use>\n      </svg>\n    </a>\n\n    \n  </figure>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"h-c-modal--video\">\n   <a class=\"glue-yt-video\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=mNjysmJNmlw\">\n   </a>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Learn more</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">To learn more about networking and AI on Google Cloud dive deeper with the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Documentation: </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/create/create-overview\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">AI Hypercomputer</span></a></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Codelabs: </span><a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/terraform-gemini-cli-gce-psc\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Gemini CLI on GCE with a Private Service Connect endpoint</span></a></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">White paper: </span><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resources/content/autonomous-network-operations?hl=en\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">Leveling up with Autonomous Network Operations</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Want to ask a question, find out more or share a thought?

        "description": "<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Upgrading a Kubernetes cluster has always been a one-way street: you move forward, and if the control plane has an issue, your only option is to roll forward with a fix. This adds significant risk to routine maintenance, a problem made worse as organizations upgrade more frequently for new AI features while demanding maximum reliability. Today, in partnership with the Kubernetes community, we are introducing a new capability in Kubernetes 1.33 that solves this: Kubernetes control-plane minor-version rollback. For the first time, you have a reliable path to revert a control-plane upgrade, fundamentally changing cluster lifecycle management.</span><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through; vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This feature is available in open-source Kubernetes, and is integrated and generally available in Google Kubernetes Engine starting in GKE 1.33 soon.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The challenge: Why were rollbacks so hard?</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Kubernetes' control plane components, especially kube-apiserver and etcd, are stateful and highly sensitive to API version changes. When you upgrade, many new APIs and features are introduced in the new binary. Some data might be migrated to new formats and API versions. Downgrading was unsupported because there was no mechanism to safely revert changes, risking data corruption and complete cluster failure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">As a simple example, consider adding a new field to an existing resource. Until now, both the storage and API progressed in a single step, allowing clients to write data to that new field immediately. If a regression was detected, rolling back removed access to that field, but the data written to it would not be garbage-collected. Instead, it would persist silently in etcd. This left the administrator in an impossible situation. Worse, upon a future re-upgrade to that minor version, this stale \"garbage\" data could suddenly become \"alive\" again, introducing potentially problematic and indeterministic behavior.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The solution: Emulated versions</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP), </span><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/4330-compatibility-versions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">KEP-4330: Compatibility Versions</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, introduces the concept of an \"emulated version\" for the control plane. Contributed by Googlers, this creates a new two-step upgrade process:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 1: Upgrade binaries. </strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">You upgrade the control plane binary, but the \"emulated version\" stays the same as the pre-upgrade version. At this stage, all APIs, features, and storage data formats remain unchanged. This makes it safe to roll back your control plane to the previously stable version if you find a problem.</span></p>\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Validate health and check for regressions.</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> The 1st step creates a safe validation window during which you can verify that it's safe to proceed \u2014 for example, making sure your own components or workloads are running healthy under the new binaries and checking for any performance regressions before committing to the new API versions.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 2:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Finalize upgrade.</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> After you complete your testing, you \"bump\" the emulated version to the new version. This enables all the new APIs and features of the latest Kubernetes release and completes the upgrade.</span></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n      <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n  \n\n    <figure class=\"article-image--large\n      \n      \n        h-c-grid__col\n        h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3\n        \n        \n      \">\n\n      \n      \n        \n        <img alt=\"image1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_dq2nDBb.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n        \n        </a>\n      \n    </figure>\n\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This two-step process gives you granular control, more observability, and a safe window for rollbacks. If an upgrade has an unexpected issue, you no longer need to scramble to roll forward. You now have a reliable way to revert to a known-good state, stabilize your cluster, and plan your next move calmly. This is all backed by comprehensive testing for the two-step upgrade in both open-source Kubernetes and GKE.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Enabling this was a major effort, and we want to thank all the Kubernetes contributors and feature owners whose collective work to test, comply, and adapt their features made this advanced capability a reality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This feature, coming soon to GKE 1.33, gives you a new tool to de-risk upgrades and dramatically shorten recovery time from unforeseen complications.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">A better upgrade experience in OSS Kubernetes</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This rollback capability is just one part of our broader, long-term investment in improving the Kubernetes upgrade experience for the entire community. At Google, we\u2019ve been working upstream on several other critical enhancements to make cluster operations smoother, safer, and more automated. Here are just a few examples:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Support for skip-version upgrades:</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> </span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our work on KEP-4330 also makes it possible to enable \"skip-level\" upgrades for Kubernetes. This means that instead of having to upgrade sequentially through every minor version (e.g., v1.33 to v1.34 to v1.35), you will be able to upgrade directly from an older version to a newer one, potentially skipping one or more intermediate releases (e.g., v1.33 to v1.35). This aims to reduce the complexity and downtime associated with major upgrades, making the process more efficient and less disruptive for cluster operators.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Coordinated Leader Election (KEP-4355):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> This effort ensures that different control plane components (like kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler) can gracefully handle leadership changes during an upgrade, so that the Kubernetes version skew policy is not violated.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Graceful Leader Transition (KEP-5366):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> Building on the above, this allows a leader to cleanly hand off its position before shutting down for an upgrade, enabling zero-downtime transitions for control plane components.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Mixed Version Proxy (KEP-4020):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> This feature improves API server reliability in mixed-version clusters (like during an upgrade). It prevents false \"NotFound\" errors by intelligently routing resource requests to a server that recognizes the resource. It also ensures discovery provides a complete list of all resources from all servers in a mixed-version cluster.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Component Health SLIs for Upgrades (KEP-3466):</strong><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> To upgrade safely, you need to know if the cluster is healthy. This KEP defines standardized Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for core Kubernetes components. This provides a clear, data-driven signal that can be used for automated upgrade canary analysis, stopping a bad rollout before it impacts the entire cluster.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Together, these features represent a major step forward in the maturity of Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management. We are incredibly proud to contribute this work to the open-source community and to bring these powerful capabilities to our GKE customers.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Learn more at KubeCon</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Want to learn more about the open-source feature and how it's changing upgrades?

Defenders will leverage artificial intelligence and agentic AI to protect against increasingly sophisticated and disruptive cybercrime operations, nation-state actors persisting on networks for long periods of time to conduct espionage and achieve other strategic goals, and adversaries who are also embracing artificial intelligence to scale and speed up attacks.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AI Threats</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>Adversaries Fully Embrace AI:</strong> We anticipate threat actors will move decisively from using AI as an exception to using it as the norm. They will leverage AI to enhance the speed, scope, and effectiveness of operations, streamlining and scaling attacks across the entire lifecycle.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>Prompt Injection Risks:</strong> A critical and growing threat is prompt injection, an attack that manipulates AI to bypass its security protocols and follow an attacker's hidden command. Expect a significant rise in targeted attacks on enterprise AI systems.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>AI-Enabled Social Engineering:</strong> Threat actors will accelerate the use of highly manipulative AI-enabled social engineering. This includes vishing (voice phishing) with AI-driven voice cloning to create hyperrealistic impersonations of executives or IT staff, making attacks harder to detect and defend against.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">AI Advantages</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>AI Agent Paradigm Shift:</strong> Widespread adoption of AI agents will create new security challenges, requiring organizations to develop new methodologies and tools to effectively map their new AI ecosystems. A key part of this will be the evolution of identity and access management (IAM) to treat AI agents as distinct digital actors with their own managed identities.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>Supercharged Security Analysts:</strong> AI adoption will transform security analysts\u2019 roles, shifting them from drowning in alerts to directing AI agents in an \u201cAgentic SOC.\u201d This will allow analysts to focus on strategic validation and high-level analysis, as AI handles data correlation, incident summaries, and threat intelligence drafting.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Cybercrime</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>Ransomware and Extortion:</strong> The combination of ransomware, data theft, and multifaceted extortion will remain the most financially disruptive category of cybercrime. The volume of activity is escalating, with focus on targeting third-party providers and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities for high-volume data exfiltration.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>The On-Chain Cybercrime Economy:</strong> As the financial sector increasingly adopts cryptocurrencies, threat actors are expected to migrate core components of their operations onto public blockchains for unprecedented resilience against traditional takedown efforts.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>Virtualization Infrastructure Under Threat:</strong> As security controls mature in guest operating systems, adversaries are pivoting to the underlying virtualization infrastructure, which is becoming a critical blind spot. A single compromise here can grant control over the entire digital estate and render hundreds of systems inoperable in a matter of hours.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Nation States</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>Russia:</strong> Cyber operations are expected to undergo a strategic shift, prioritizing long-term global strategic goals and the development of advanced cyber capabilities over just tactical support for the conflict in Ukraine.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>China:</strong> The volume of China-nexus cyber operations is expected to continue surpassing that of other nations.

This was a major setup step, and if done incorrectly, jobs could get fragmented resources from different, unconnected slices, causing severe performance bottlenecks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This new library, </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">ray.util.tpu</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, abstracts away these hardware details. It uses a feature called </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">SlicePlacementGroup</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> along with the new </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">label_selector</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> API to automatically reserve the entire, co-located TPU slice as one atomic unit. This guarantees the job runs on unified hardware, preventing performance issues from fragmentation. Because Ray couldn't guarantee this single-slice atomicity before, building reliable true multi-slice training (which intentionally spans multiple unique slices) was impossible. This new API also provides the critical foundation for Ray users to use Multislice technology to scale using multiple TPU slices.</span></p>\n<h3><strong style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Expanded support for Jax, Ray Train and Ray Serve\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Our developments cover both training and inference. For training, Ray Train now offers alpha support for JAX (via </span><a href=\"https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/distributed-training-tpu\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">JaxTrainer</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">) and PyTorch on TPUs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">The </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">JaxTrainer</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> API simplifies running JAX workloads on multi-host TPUs. It now automatically handles the complex distributed host initialization. As shown in the code example below, you only need to define your hardware needs\u2014like the number of workers, topology, and accelerator type\u2014within a simple </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">ScalingConfig</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> object. The </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">JaxTrainer</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> takes care of the rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This is a significant improvement because it solves a critical performance problem: resource fragmentation. Previously, a job requesting a \"4x4\" topology (which must run on a single co-located hardware unit called a slice) could instead receive fragmented resources\u2014for example, eight chips from one physical slice and eight chips from a different, unconnected slice. This fragmentation was a major bottleneck, as it prevented the workload from using the high-speed ICI interconnect that only exists within a single, unified slice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Example of how the JaxTrainer simplifies training on multi-host TPU:</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"block-code\"><dl>\n    <dt>code_block</dt>\n    <dd>&lt;ListValue: [StructValue([(&#x27;code&#x27;, &#x27;import jax\\r\\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\\r\\nimport optax\\r\\nimport ray.train\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom ray.train.v2.jax import JaxTrainer\\r\\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\\r\\n\\r\\ndef train_func():\\r\\n&quot;&quot;&quot;This function is run on each distributed worker.&quot;&quot;&quot;\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\n# Define the hardware configuration for your distributed job.\\r\\nscaling_config = ScalingConfig(\\r\\nnum_workers=4,\\r\\nuse_tpu=True,\\r\\ntopology=&quot;4x4&quot;,\\r\\naccelerator_type=&quot;TPU-V6E&quot;,\\r\\nplacement_strategy=&quot;SPREAD&quot;\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Define and run the JaxTrainer.\\r\\ntrainer = JaxTrainer(\\r\\ntrain_loop_per_worker=train_func,\\r\\nscaling_config=scaling_config,\\r\\n)\\r\\nresult = trainer.fit()\\r\\nprint(f&quot;Training finished on TPU v6e 4x4 slice&quot;)&#x27;), (&#x27;language&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;), (&#x27;caption&#x27;, &lt;wagtail.rich_text.RichText object at 0x7fe168097250&gt;)])]&gt;</dd>\n</dl></div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_advanced\"><p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">Ray Serve APIs support TPUs and with the improvements we have made to </span><a href=\"https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/10/16/vllm-tpu.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;\">vLLM TPU</span></a><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, you can continue to use Ray on vLLM when moving to TPUs.

With a simple </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">label_selector</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">, you can request hardware like \"TPU-V6E\" or target your </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">cost-optimized</code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\"> class, all without managing separate YAML files.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">This same </span><code style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">label_selector </code><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">mechanism also exposes deep hardware control for TPUs. As GKE provisions the TPU pods for a slice, it injects metadata (like worker rank and topology) into each one. KubeRay (which manages Ray on GKE) then reads this GKE-provided metadata and automatically translates it into Ray-specific labels as it creates the nodes. This provides key information like the TPU generation (ray.io/accelerator-type), the physical chip topology (ray.io/tpu-topology), and the worker rank within the slice (</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">ray.io/tpu-worker-id</span><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">These node labels let you use a Ray label_selector to pin SPMD workloads to specific, co-located hardware, such as a \"4x4\" topology or a particular worker rank.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"vertical-align: baseline;\">In the example below, a Ray user can request a v6e-32 TPU slice but instruct GKE to use custom compute classes to fallback to v5e-16 if that\u2019s not available. Similarly, the user could start by requesting spot or DWS resources and if not available, fallback to reservation instances.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div align=\"left\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368; width: 100%;\">\n<div style=\"color: #5f6368;
