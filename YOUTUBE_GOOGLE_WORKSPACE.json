        "description": "Featured in this video: Francis Pugeda, Director for AI Delivery, Globe Telecom\n\nExecutive summary: In 2013, Globe Telecom, the largest mobile telecommunication company in the Philippines, embraced Google Workspace to solve challenges with outdated collaboration tools, significantly boosting employee satisfaction. Now, Globe Telecom has integrated Gemini into its workflows. Through extensive training, the company has seen 80% adoption, with 87% of users gaining 3-4 hours of productivity per week, empowering staff to maximize AI in their daily tasks.\n\nChallenge: Prior to 2013, Globe Telecom struggled with traditional workplace bottlenecks: full inboxes, version control issues with email attachments, and high costs due to frequent tool replacements. As the largest telecom in the Philippines, the company needed a modern, secure, and cost-effective solution that would simplify communication and collaboration. Then, when generative AI emerged, Globe Telecom wanted to strategically integrate the technology across the tools and processes that power its business.\n\nSolution: Globe Telecom became the first company to adopt Google Workspace in the Philippines in 2013. This platform offered seamless, browser-based collaboration, co-editing, universal document access, and robust single sign-on security. Building on this foundation, Globe Telecom strategically introduced Gemini, focusing on empowering people and processes with the latest technology. The team identified early adopters, conducted extensive training on using Gemini across Workspace applications, and created a Google Chat space for users to share experiences.\n\nResult: The initial adoption of Google Workspace significantly improved employee satisfaction, with their promoter score rising from 73 in 2011 to 90 in 2016. With the introduction of Gemini, adoption rose to 80% among employees. They primarily use Gemini in Gmail to polish emails, in Google Docs for inspiration, and in the Gemini app. A notable discovery was the ability to create AI chatbots using NotebookLM by feeding it documents. Following the rollout of Gemini, 87% of users agreed they are more productive, saving an average of three to four hours per week. This empowers employees to discover and maximize AI capabilities within their workflows.\n\nWhat is Google Workspace \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nDoIVq\n\nSet up Google Workspace \u2192 http://goo.gle/42rmAb1\nSubscribe to Google Workspace \u2192 https://goo.gle/GoogleWorkspace\n\nTry Google Workspace with Gemini \u2192 http://goo.gle/42sSRyt\nFollow Google Workspace on X \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nI3LJ6\nFollow Google Workspace on Facebook \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nAlYYR\nFollow Google Workspace on LinkedIn \u2192 http://goo.gle/4gXZFdn\nFollow Google Workspace on Instagram \u2192 http://goo.gle/46E66i7\nFollow Google Workspace on TikTok \u2192 http://goo.gle/4h7VknV\nFollow Google Workspace on Threads \u2192 http://goo.gle/46Zfjk8\n\n#GoogleWorkspace \n#GoogleWorkspaceWithGemini",

When evaluating AI technologies, the team chose Gemini for its enterprise-grade security and privacy protections that meet its clients\u2019 requirements. The integration of Gemini across the Workspace solutions that teams already know saves time on mundane tasks while enabling them to focus on strategic work like creating new policies and shortening creative production timelines.\n\nChallenge: As emerging AI technologies gained popularity, VaynerX clients \u2014 particularly Fortune 500 companies \u2014 needed guidance on AI adoption but had strict requirements that their data could not be used to train any models. The agency needed sophisticated enterprise AI partners who could understand both VaynerX's needs and its clients' security and privacy requirements while working in an asynchronous, multi-timezone environment.\n\nSolution: VaynerX chose Google Workspace with Gemini because the company already used the full Workspace suite to power collaboration and productivity. The platform also offered industry-leading protections with superior security and privacy controls. The team integrated Gemini across workflows to support the full marketing lifecycle, from insights and strategy to activation \n\nResult: The implementation of Google Workspace with Gemini delivered immediate practical value and strategic advantages. Legal teams save significant time with automated meeting notes and summaries in Google Meet, while creative and media teams use AI to shorten production timelines and reduce costs for clients. Gemini handles mundane tasks, freeing up teams to focus on high-value work like creating new policies and procedures that help business partners create better content. It also enables faster transition from insights and strategy to smart activation plans, and supports more effective post-campaign analysis to optimize for the future.\n\nWhat is Google Workspace \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nDoIVq\n\nSet up Google Workspace \u2192 http://goo.gle/42rmAb1\nSubscribe to Google Workspace \u2192 https://goo.gle/GoogleWorkspace\n\nTry Google Workspace with Gemini \u2192 http://goo.gle/42sSRyt\nFollow Google Workspace on X \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nI3LJ6\nFollow Google Workspace on Facebook \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nAlYYR\nFollow Google Workspace on LinkedIn \u2192 http://goo.gle/4gXZFdn\nFollow Google Workspace on Instagram \u2192 http://goo.gle/46E66i7\nFollow Google Workspace on TikTok \u2192 http://goo.gle/4h7VknV\nFollow Google Workspace on Threads \u2192 http://goo.gle/46Zfjk8\n\n#GoogleWorkspace \n#GoogleWorkspaceWithGemini",

With a central collaboration solution its international offices are empowered to work together asynchronously, and deliver a consistent, global client experience. The company can also pioneer new client strategies and deliver more quickly with Gemini built into its everyday workflows. With features like \"\"Take Notes for Me\"\" and image generation capabilities combined with Workspace\u2019s enterprise-grade security controls, VaynerX ensures consistent client deliverables and meets ambitious goals while minimizing risk.\n\nChallenge: VaynerX supports a wide range of clients by helping them unlock their potential through creative and media. Working with this diverse portfolio also means accessing and managing a large volume of client assets, and the company has to ensure that client data is secure even as it implements new technologies like generative AI. Internally, the company needs to stay aligned across its international offices to deliver the best possible work to clients efficiently and at scale.\n\nSolution: By adopting Google Workspace with Gemini the company is able to keep aligned while meeting both its innovation and security goals. The global team works across the Workspace suite to collaborate on Google Meet, Slides, Sheets, and more from Mexico City to Miami to Delhi. More recently, with Gemini embedded throughout VaynerX\u2019s Workspace products, the team has developed custom gems that can be trained on publicly available information to better understand and meet client needs. \n\nResult: By centralizing the team\u2019s collaborative and creative efforts, VaynerX is able to deliver a truly global experience. Now, with generative AI built into their everyday workflows, VaynerX can pioneer new strategies for clients. With Take Notes for Me, every team from production to creative, media, and strategy all have a secure, accurate notetaker to ensure consistency across client deliverables. Plus, since Gemini shares permission and access controls with the full Workspace suite, the team can continue to meet its ambitious goals without sacrificing privacy and security. \n\nHighlights and key takeaways from our interview with Avery Akkineni, Chief Marketing Officer, VaynerX:\n\nWhat is Google Workspace \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nDoIVq\n\nSet up Google Workspace \u2192 http://goo.gle/42rmAb1\nSubscribe to Google Workspace \u2192 https://goo.gle/GoogleWorkspace\n\nTry Google Workspace with Gemini \u2192 http://goo.gle/42sSRyt\nFollow Google Workspace on X \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nI3LJ6\nFollow Google Workspace on Facebook \u2192 http://goo.gle/4nAlYYR\nFollow Google Workspace on LinkedIn \u2192 http://goo.gle/4gXZFdn\nFollow Google Workspace on Instagram \u2192 http://goo.gle/46E66i7\nFollow Google Workspace on TikTok \u2192 http://goo.gle/4h7VknV\nFollow Google Workspace on Threads \u2192 http://goo.gle/46Zfjk8\n\n#GoogleWorkspace \n#GoogleWorkspaceWithGemini",
