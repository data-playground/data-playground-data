Without the right data architecture, Tableau dashboards quickly become slow, brittle, or impossible to maintain.\n\nIn this session, I’ll share practical strategies to architect marketing attribution data for performance and scale using a modular, open-source stack (Fivetran + dbt + Snowflake). We’ll discuss how to:\nDesign aggregate tables that balance query performance with analytical flexibility.\n\nPrecompute multi-touch attribution metrics (Markov, Shapley) for efficient Tableau visualization.\n\nImplement parameter-driven dashboards that let users toggle attribution models or time windows without performance lag.\n\nLeverage Tableau Prep and incremental data pipelines to keep dashboards fresh and consistent.\n\nYou’ll leave with a blueprint for high-performance Tableau dashboards that handle terabyte-scale marketing data while remaining responsive, accurate, and executive-ready.",
